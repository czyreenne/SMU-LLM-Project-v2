    "scenario": "Azlin, 38, is a newly-minted equity partner specialising in commercial law at a mid-sized\nSingapore law \ufb01rm. Her husband Kok Tong, also 38, does investments and trading at a\nlocal bank. The two had recently gotten married in Jan 2020.\nOn 1 Feb 2020, they moved into a 3 storey landed bungalow they had bought in the Katong\narea. The house is one of those nice heritage houses with a long colonial history. It is part\nof a cluster of houses designed and built in 1940 by Due South Ltd, now a big listed\nSingapore property developer. After the cluster was built, title of the common areas was\nvested in the estate\u2019s MCST. Azlin and Kok Tong (henceforth \u201cA&K\u201d) are the third owners\nof the house. They of\ufb01cially took over ownership on 31 Oct 2019.\nBefore moving in, they engaged Disastrous Interiors Pte Ltd (\u201cDI\u201d), an interior design\nand furniture company, to plan and also implement a series of renovations. This included\nbuilding a new wall fountain in their living room (the sort where water \ufb02ows down along\na feature wall and into a pool). To preserve the heritage feel of the house, A&K asked that\nDI construct the fountain on an existing 3-metre long stretch of heritage wall that lined\ntheir living room. DI inserts some water pipes and pumps in the wall to make this happen.\nThey also add some claddings to the heritage wall. The $300,000 contract between A&K\nand DI does not contain any relevant exclusion clause.\nA&K\u2019s discussions with DI took place over Nov 2019. From 1 Dec 2019 to 31 Jan 2020,\nDI cordoned off the house as a construction site, putting up the usual barriers and warnings,\nand carried out the renovations. From time to time DI would invite A&K over to have a\nlook at the progress, and A&K would give some creative direction and feedback.\nUnfortunately for the newlyweds, their new life together was fraught with twists and turns.\nWithin a month of moving in, they received a lawyer\u2019s letter from one Tom, a 24 year old\nphotographer who specialises in taking pictures for interior design magazines. On 15 Jan\n2020, Tom had passed by the house on his way to a photoshoot. From outside, Tom could\nsee from over the 1.5m tall construction site fence that a beautifully renovated colonial\nhouse stood behind it. He thus climbed over the fence hoping to take a few pictures. Tom\n AY2020/21-II\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n3\ndid not however notice a long electrical wire that was carelessly strewn across the \ufb02oor.\nHe tripped, dropping and breaking his $2,500 camera. Because his camera was broken,\nhe also had to miss the photoshoot he was heading to that day, making for lost pro\ufb01ts of a\nfurther $10,000. He is now demanding compensation for both from A&K only.\nIn Feb 2020, parts of the wall fountain started breaking off and falling into the pool below.\nIt turned out that DI completely miscalculated how much weight the wall would be able\nto bear. Due South had built the wall exactly to 1940 standards (which were signi\ufb01cantly\nlower than today\u2019s). A&K will need to pay $200,000 to re-do the entire wall and wall\nfountain. They are hoping to claim compensation for this from either Due South or DI or\nboth.\nFinally, within days of moving in, the couple starting hearing strange noises and having\nstrange sightings in the house. They had heard from the previous owners a folk tale that\nthe house was previously used as a holding area for prisoners during the Sook Ching\nmassacre.1 They would catch momentary glimpses of what seemed like a phantom dressed\nlike the Japanese military police patrolling their corridors. Once the phantom even shouted\nAzlin\u2019s name. Kok Tong is a serious history buff who knows about the atrocities committed\nduring the time. He is very afraid and has many sleepless nights. Eventually he develops\nsevere paranoia, a recognised psychiatric injury.\nAzlin, who witnesses her husband slowly falling into paranoia, is extremely distressed as\nwell. She takes it upon herself to confront the phantom. Having practiced law for so many\nyears, she had developed nerves of steel. One night, as the phantom emerged, she lunges\nat it without thinking. To her utmost surprise, she did not pass right through the phantom.\nInstead, both of them fell to the ground. \u201cOuch! That hurt!\u201d, belches the \u2018phantom\u2019. It was\nactually Hartono, Azlin\u2019s jilted ex-boyfriend, who had been jealous of the newlyweds. He\nhad spent the last month sneaking into their home trying sabotage their relationship. He\nespecially wanted to scare Azlin into leaving Kok Tong.\n1This was a period during the Japanese Occupation (1942\u20131945) where thousands of Singaporeans were\nmurdered by the Japanese military.",

            "My answer is:\n**Issue**: Did A&K owe a duty of care to Tom?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a duty of care arises when the defendant has created a state of affairs which he knows or ought to have known would, if not controlled, cause damage to the plaintiff. (Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605)\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, A&K engaged DI to carry out renovations on their house, which included building a wall fountain. They knew or ought to have known that the construction site would attract visitors, as Tom was passing by and decided to take pictures. They had a duty to take reasonable care to prevent harm to visitors. However, they failed to ensure that the construction site was safe, as evidenced by the electrical wire strewn across the floor. This breach of duty caused Tom's camera to be broken and him to miss a photoshoot.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, A&K did owe a duty of care to Tom and breached that duty, making them liable for Tom's damages.\n\n**Issue**: Can A&K claim against DI for the damages caused by the wall fountain?\n\n**Rule**: Under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Cap 53B), a third party can enforce a term of a contract if the contract expressly provides for this, or if it is reasonable to infer from the contract that the parties intended to confer a benefit on the third party.\n\n**Application**: The contract between A&K and DI does not contain any relevant exclusion clause, and it is reasonable to infer that A&K intended to confer a benefit on themselves as the owners of the house. Therefore, A&K can claim against DI for the damages caused by the wall fountain.\n\n**Issue**: Can Kok Tong claim against Due South for his psychiatric injury?\n\n**Rule**: Under the Occupiers' Liability Act (Cap 222), an occupier of premises owes a duty to visitors to take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purpose for which he is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there.\n\n**Application**: Due South is the occupier of the common areas of the estate, and Kok Tong is a visitor to those areas. However, Kok Tong's psychiatric injury was not caused by any defect in the common areas, but rather by the presence of Hartono in the house. Therefore, Due South does not owe a duty of care to Kok Tong in this regard.\n\n**Conclusion**: Kok Tong cannot claim",

            "My answer is:\n**Issue**: Whether A&K can claim damages from Due South for the defective wall.\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a claim in negligence requires the plaintiff to establish that the defendant owed them a duty of care, breached that duty, and caused damage as a result. In the context of property defects, the occupier's liability provisions in the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (BMSMA) may apply. Section 10(1) of the BMSMA imposes a duty on the developer to ensure that the building is fit for habitation and occupation. However, this duty is subject to a limitation period of six years from the date of completion of the building (Section 10(3) BMSMA).\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Due South built the house in 1940, and A&K purchased it in 2019. The wall was constructed to 1940 standards, which were significantly lower than today's. DI miscalculated the wall's weight-bearing capacity, leading to damage. A&K may argue that Due South breached their duty under the BMSMA by not ensuring the building was fit for habitation and occupation. However, the six-year limitation period may be a barrier to their claim, as the house was built more than 80 years ago.\n\n**Conclusion**: While A&K may have a potential claim against Due South for the defective wall, the limitation period under the BMSMA may prevent them from pursuing this claim successfully. They should seek legal advice to determine the viability of their claim.\n\n**Issue**: Whether A&K can claim damages from DI for the defective wall.\n\n**Rule**: A claim in negligence against a contractor requires A&K to establish that DI owed them a duty of care, breached that duty, and caused damage as a result.

The contract between A&K and DI does not contain any relevant exclusion clauses, suggesting that DI's liability for negligence may not be limited. A&K can claim damages from DI for the cost of redoing the wall and wall fountain, which amounts to $200,000.\n\n**Conclusion**: A&K can claim damages from DI for the defective wall, as DI breached their duty of care and caused damage.
