    "scenario": "Aisya, 38, is a newly-minted equity partner specialising in commercial law at a mid-sized\nSingapore law \ufb01rm. Her husband Kwan, also 38, does investments and trading at a local\nbank. The two had recently gotten married in Jan 2020.\nOn 1 Feb 2020, they moved into a 3 storey landed bungalow they had bought in the Katong\narea. The house is one of those nice heritage houses with a long colonial history. It\nwas designed and built in 1940 by Due South Ltd, now a big listed Singapore property\ndeveloper. Aisya and Kwan (henceforth \u201cA&K\u201d) are the \ufb01fth owners of the house. They\nof\ufb01cially took over ownership on 31 Oct 2019.\nBefore moving in, they engaged Safe Interiors Pte Ltd (\u201cSI\u201d), an interior design and furni-\nture company, to plan and also implement a series of renovations. This included building\na new wall fountain in their living room (the sort where water \ufb02ows down along a fea-\nture wall and into a pool). To preserve the heritage feel of the house, A&K asked that SI\nconstruct the fountain on an existing 3-metre long stretch of heritage wall that lined their\nliving room. SI inserts some water pipes and pumps in the wall to make this happen. They\nalso add some claddings to the heritage wall. The $200,000 contract between A&K and\nSI does not contain any relevant exclusion clause.\nA&K\u2019s discussions with SI took place over Nov 2019. From 1 Dec 2019 to 31 Jan 2020, SI\ncordoned off the house as a construction site, putting up the usual barriers and warnings,\nand carried out the renovations. From time to time SI would invite A&K over to have a\nlook at the progress, and A&K would give some creative direction and feedback.\nUnfortunately for the newlyweds, their new life together was fraught with twists and turns.\nWithin a month of moving in, they received a lawyer\u2019s letter from one Tommy, a 24 year\nold photographer who specialises in taking pictures for interior design magazines. On\n15 Jan 2020, SI had closed but forgotten to lock the construction site gate. The wind\nwas very strong that day and so blew the gate ajar. Passing by outside, Tommy spied a\nbeautifully renovated colonial house and ventured in to take a few pictures. Tommy did\nnot however notice a long electrical wire that was carelessly strewn across the \ufb02oor. He\n AY2020/21-II\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n3\ntripped, dropping and breaking his $10,000 camera. Because his camera was broken, he\nalso had to miss the photoshoot he was heading to that day, making for lost pro\ufb01ts of a\nfurther $25,000. He is now demanding compensation for both from A&K only.\nAround Feb 2020, parts of the wall fountain started breaking off and falling into the pool\nbelow. It turned out that the original heritage wall as designed and built by Due South was\ndefective. The result is that it would easily disintegrate if some weight was placed on it.\nThere was nothing wrong with SI\u2019s fountain or the materials they used. But because A&K\nhad speci\ufb01cally asked for the fountain to be built on that wall, SI did not check whether\nthe wall was suitable for a wall fountain to begin with. A&K will need to pay $100,000\nto re-do the entire wall and wall fountain. They are hoping to claim compensation for this\nfrom either Due South or SI or both.\nFinally, within days of moving in, the couple starting hearing strange noises and having\nstrange sightings in the house. They had heard from the previous owners a folk tale that\nthe house was previously used as a holding area for prisoners during the Sook Ching\nmassacre.1 They would catch momentary glimpses of what seemed like a phantom dressed\nlike the Japanese military police patrolling their corridors. Once the phantom even shouted\nKwan\u2019s name. Kwan is a serious history buff who knows about the atrocities committed\nduring the time. He is very afraid and has many sleepless nights. Eventually he develops\nsevere paranoia, a recognised psychiatric injury.\nAisya, who witnesses her husband slowly falling into paranoia, is extremely distressed as\nwell. She takes it upon herself to confront the phantom. Having practiced law for so many\nyears, she had developed nerves of steel. One night, as the phantom emerged, she lunges\nat it without thinking. To her utmost surprise, she did not pass right through the phantom.\nInstead, both of them fell to the ground. \u201cOuch! That hurt!\u201d, belches the \u2018phantom\u2019. It\nwas actually Harto, Aisya\u2019s jilted ex-boyfriend, who had been jealous of the newlyweds.\nHe had spent the last month sneaking into their home trying sabotage their relationship.\nHe especially wanted to scare Kwan into leaving Aisya.\n1This was a period during the Japanese Occupation (1942\u20131945) where thousands of Singaporeans were\nmurdered by the Japanese military.",

            "##  Analyzing the Scenario for Tort Claims\n\n**1. Issue:**\n\nDoes Aisya have a legal basis to sue A&K (due to the fact that the original design of the house was done by Due South, and they are being sued for the damage caused by the \u2018phantom\u2019 to be a result of their new home's purchase.\n\n\n**2. Rule:**\n\nThis scenario presents a potential tort claim based on negligence. \n\nTo establish a tort claim for negligence, the following elements must be proven:\n\n* **Duty of Care:** A&K owed a duty of care to Aisya and his wife as they are their clients and customers.\n* **Breach of Duty:** As a result of the situation described in the scenario, A&K's actions would be considered negligent if they were aware of the potential for the \u2018camera\u2019 issue.\n\n**3. Application:**\n\nThe question of whether or not an individual can sue for negligence based on the design and construction of the wall is crucial to understanding the potential legal issues. \n\n* **Duty of Care:**\n\nWe need more information to determine if A&K had a duty of care towards A&K's wife in this case. The fact that the \u2018photographer\u2019 was a man who wanted to see how the house was built and designed is irrelevant to whether or not there is a legal basis for a claim against them.\n\n* **Liability:**\n\nThe scenario states that the wall was \"easily\" falling apart, which suggests that A&K's wife suffered an injury due to the firm\u2019s failure to provide adequate safety measures. This implies that the firm may have breached their duty of care towards her if they were aware of the potential for this to happen and failed to take necessary precautions during the construction process.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nIn this case, it seems **unlikely that A&K's wife would be able to successfully sue Due South**, the company responsible for building the wall fountain. \n\n* **Reasoning:**\n\nThe scenario mentions that the firm is being sued for a \u2018camera\u2019 issue. This suggests that the firm is being sued by someone else, likely the original photographer who was injured. A&K's wife would not be suing Due South in this case because she was\ninjured due to their actions. If the firm had been involved with the design and construction of the house in any way that caused injury to them, then they are\nlikely to have a claim against Due South for the injuries sustained.\n\n**However, there might be grounds for A&K to pursue legal action against him**, if the \u2018camera\u2019 issue was a result of his concerns about the safety of the wall and the firm's failure to adequately address them. \n\n\n**Therefore, A&K's wife could potentially have a claim against the Japanese government** for negligence if she suffered an injury due to the \u2018camera\u2019",

Let's analyze the potential tort claim(s) based on the information provided:\n\n\n**1. Negligence:**\n\n* **Issue**: Does the scenario present a valid claim for negligence? \n* **Rule**: To establish a negligence claim, one must prove four elements:\n    * Duty of care: A&K's firm had to have a duty of care towards the structure of the house and its suitability for the purpose of the wall fountain.\n    * Breach of duty: The contractor (Due South) breached their duty by failing to ensure the safety of the wall, which led to the accident.\n    * Causation: A&K's camera is a key factor in this scenario.

Potential Tort Claims**:\n\n* **Possible claims against A&K**: \n    * **Negligence:** If the contractor (Due South) was aware of the potential dangers of the wall being unsuitable for a photoshoot with the weight of the equipment, and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent harm to people due to this knowledge. This would be a potential claim if the firm had been negligent in their actions.\n* **Potential claims against A&K**:\n\n**2.1. For the \"Jilted Lover\" situation:**\n\n* **Negligence (continued):** If A&K's negligence caused the photographer to break his camera, causing him to miss out on a photoshoot and suffering financial loss due to the damage to his equipment.\n* **Liability**:  A&K\u2019s legal liability for the injury would depend on whether they were aware of the potential for harm (the \"Jilted Lover\" situation). If A&K could have reasonably foreseen that the lack of a secure gate in the original installation could lead to damage to the photographer's equipment, and if he was injured due to this lack of safety precautions, then there would be a strong case for liability.\n\n**2.2. Potential defenses**: \n* **Contributory negligence**: If the photographer is found to have been aware of the risk of the wall being unsuitable (due to the \"Japanese\" theme) and still entered into it, he may be partially or fully responsible for the damages depending on the degree of negligence.\n\n**3.

            "##  A&K's Tort Claim\n\n**a. Issue:**\n\nThe issue here is whether A&K can bring a tort claim against anyone for the injuries sustained by their photographer due to the incident involving the falling of the \u2018phantom\u2019 (the original owner) into the wall. \n\n**b. Rule:**\n\nIn Singapore law, a tort claim arises when someone suffers harm due to the negligence of another person. To establish a tort claim, A&K would need to prove:\n\n* **Duty of Care:** The photographer had a duty of care towards Aisya and their\nhusband as they were invited to the house for professional purposes.\n* **Breach of Duty:** The \u2018photographer\u2019s\u2019 fear of being a \u2018jilted ex-boyfriend\u2019 is irrelevant to the legal situation. A&K would only have a claim if the photographer was injured due to the negligence of Due South or any other party involved in the construction and design of the wall.\n* **Causation:** While the question mentions A&K's \"nerves of steel,\" it doesn't mention any specific details about how their situation is related to the incident. \n\n**c. Application:**\n\nThe fact that A&K, the original owners of a house, are being sued for damages by Due Sook (the fifth) after the new renovations were completed, suggests that there may be a claim against the company for negligence.\n\n\n**d. Conclusion:**\n\nThe question doesn't provide enough information to determine if A&K's liability is established. \nTo establish a tort claim against someone for negligence, it needs to be proven that they owed a duty of care and breached that duty. \n\n**Here's where the \u2018photographer\u2019s\u2019 situation comes into play:**\n\n* **The \u2018photographer\u2019s\u2019 (the original owner) actions are relevant to this case because**:\n    * He was invited to the house for a specific purpose, which is to take pictures of the photographer\u2019s holding area. \n    * His actions on the property while working as a photographer for SI could be considered a breach of duty if he acted negligently in causing the injury.\n\n**a. \u2018He\u2019 (the original owner) would have been aware that**:\n\n\nThe fact that the situation involves a \"falling\" incident, and the 'photographer's' claim to be a \"holding\" company, suggests a potential for a tort claim for negligence. \n\n**e.

            "Yes, Kwan and Aisya could potentially have a claim for an **intentional tort** against the company against them.\n\nHere's why:\n\n**1.  Negligence:**\n\n* **Rule**: A&K has been in a newly-formed partnership with Due Interiors Pte Ltd. The firm is demanding $25,000 in damages for the cost of the entire wall to be redone.\nThis suggests that there may be a claim for negligence against the company if they are able to prove that the firm was aware of the potential danger posed by the \u2018phantom\u2019 situation and failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate it.\n\n**2. Negligence:**\n\n* **Issue**: Can A&K be held liable for A&K's actions?\n* **Application**: Yes, this is where the scenario gets interesting. While the question mentions a \"heritage wall\" that was built by Due Interiors and the company\u2019s actions are not mentioned to be designed to support it, there are several ways to approach this situation.\n\n**2.  Negligence**:\n\n* **Rule**: Negligence is a failure to exercise the standard of care expected of a person in a particular situation.\n* **Application**: If the firm owed a duty of care to A&K and breached that duty by failing to take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of the \u2018further\u2019 from the 5th floor, then they could be held liable for the cost of repairs if the firm is found to have been negligent in their work.\n\n**2. Negligence**:\n\n* **Conclusion**: This situation presents a legal issue because the firm would have had to take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of the structure and its surroundings. If their negligence led to the incident, it could be argued that they are liable for the damages caused by the accident.\n\n\n**2.  Negligent Misrepresentation:**\n\n* **Rule**: Negligence in a professional context can create liability if the firm provided false information about the wall\u2019s condition or structural integrity.\n* **Application**: The fact that the \u2018phantom\u2019 was able to access the original 5th floor and the context of the \u2018heritage wall\u2019 is crucial here.\n\n**2.

            "## Tort-Related Issues for Aisya and Kwan\n\n**A**: **Yes, there are several tort-related issues to consider.**\n\n**B**: **Here's why:**\n\n1. **Negligence**: While the analysis of the scenario mentions a \"new\" element (the pipes and materials used in the bungalow), it doesn't explicitly state that A&K was injured due to the negligence of Due South. \n2. **Duty of Care**: If A&K was injured due to the defects in the fountain, they would have grounds to argue for a duty of care owed by the company.\n\n**C**:  Based on the facts provided, it seems that A&K may have grounds to sue Due South for negligence. The fact that the original walls were \"easily disintegrated\" suggests that there was a defect in their construction. \n\n**However**, the scenario states that the wall and the contractor's (Due South) actions are being framed within the context of a legal claim. This means we need to consider:\n\n* **Causation**: A&K would need to prove that the firm\u2019s negligence caused the injury. The fact that Due South is a \"fifth\" owner and the furniture is built on a 3-meter long section of the bungalow, which was a key factor in their decision to purchase the property, doesn't necessarily mean they are liable for the damage caused by the placement of the furniture.\n\n* **Liability**: The firm\u2019s negligence in constructing the wall\nwould be a factor in determining liability. If A&K had not taken any steps to ensure the safety of the structure (like ensuring it was safe to use) then they may have a claim against the photographer for the damage to their property.\n\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThe fact that A&K\u2019s \"paranoia\" is specifically mentioned suggests that the firm might be liable for damages if they were injured due to the construction of the wall. If A&K\u2019s actions caused damage to the property, it could be argued that they are responsible for the cost of repairs. However, the situation with the \"phantom\" and the bungalow's suitability for a specific purpose is more complex.\n\n**Important Note**:\n\nThis scenario raises several legal issues regarding the potential liability of Due South (the firm) for the damage to the property caused by their actions. \nIt implies that A&K was a recent purchase, suggesting they may have been aware of the \"defect\" in the house and chosen to ignore it.\n\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThe information provided suggests that there might be a claim for negligence against Due South for the design of the bungalow. The fact that the firm is being sued for the construction of the wall suggests that A&K\u2019s actions were not taken into account.\n",
            "##  Analyzing the Scenario under Singapore Law\n\nThis scenario presents several interesting points for analysis under Singapore law. Here's a breakdown of potential tort-related issues:\n\n\n**LAW 105: Law of Tots - The Sook Ching Holding Company**\n\n**4. Potential Tort-Related Issues for A&K**\n\n**a. Potential Liability:**\n\n**b. Duty of Care:**\n\n* **Negligence**: This is the most likely tort claim in this scenario. It involves a breach of duty of care, which is the duty to take reasonable care to avoid causing harm to others. \n* **Duty to Occupiers**: Since Aisya's husband was a \u2018heritage\u2019 enthusiast who knew about the Sook Ching holding A&K's actions during the photoshoot could have been dangerous and caused injury to someone else.\n\n**c. Potential for a Claim:**\n\n* **Against Due South**: If the story is true, the fact that Kwan's paranoia led him to directly injure himself (by shouting at him) by falling on him while he was trying to \u2018sneak\u2019 into the house suggests that A&K may have breached their duty of care towards him.\n* **For A&K:**\n\nThis situation presents a unique twist to A&K's potential liability. \n\n**d. Potential for a Claim Against the Photographer**:\n\n* **Negligence**: If Kwan is the plaintiff, he could potentially sue Aisya\u2019s firm for negligence. This would be a difficult claim to prove because it would be necessary to show that the original design of the wall was inherently unsafe and that this defect caused him to fall into the \u2018phantom\u2019 situation.\n* **Vicarious Liability**:\n\nIf Kwan decides to pursue a claim against A&K's firm, he will have to prove that the construction of the house was not safe for the photoshoot. \n* **Duty of Care:**\n\nA&K's firm would be liable for any injuries sustained by Aisya due to her firm\u2019s actions. If the \u2018phantom\u2019 situation is a result of A&K\u2019s firm\u2019s negligence, then they could be held liable for their client\u2019s injury.\n* **Causation**:\n\nThe fact that the wall was not designed to be safe for the photographer would be a key factor in determining whether the firm is liable for his injuries. \n\n\n**d. The case of the \u2018phantom\u2019**:\n\nIt seems like A&K are both trying to make a claim against each other.\nThis is where the concept of \u2018sook ching\u2019 comes into play. It is important to note that this is a legal issue, not a factual one. If the \u2018wall\u2019 was built in a way that made it unsafe for the photographer, A&K could argue that the firm should have known about the danger and taken steps to prevent it.\n\n**d.
