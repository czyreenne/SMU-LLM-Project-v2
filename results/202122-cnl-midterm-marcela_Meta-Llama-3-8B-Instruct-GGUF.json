    "scenario": "Twenty-eight year old Marcela is a streamer who has built a sizeable fan base (of around\n500,000 subscribers) on the augmented reality (AR) streaming platform \u201cWitch\u201d. The\nplatform was founded 6 years ago and is based in Singapore. Its main selling point is a\nrange of AR \ufb01lters called \u2014 \u201cperspectives\u201d or \u201cpaxes\u201d by the community \u2014 which let\nstreamers superimpose hyper-realistic 3D graphics over real world video. These can be\nactivated at the click of a button, and streamers generally do not concern themselves with\nhow they work.\nThe platform rose to fame because of its dedication towards helping its creators make con-\ntent (and money) \u201clike magic\u201d. Since the beginning, Witch maintained a \u201ccreator \ufb01rst\u201d\npolicy which very publicly declares that all subscription fees \u201cgo directly in the \ufb01rst in-\nstance to our content creators; we only take a modest amount to keep the platform run-\nning\u201d. This modest amount is 10% of the subscription fee viewers pay. Creators alone\ndecide how much to set these fees at. In this regard, Witch differs from usual platforms\nwhere, in those other platforms, (1) viewer money goes \ufb01rst to the platform which takes\na cut before disbursing funds to the streamer\u2019s account, (2) average platform fees range\nbetween 20\u201330%; and (3) creators are required to charge an amount the platform sets.\nThe relationship between Witch and its creators is shaped by Witch\u2019s Terms of Use which\nbinds both creators and viewers alike. The Terms state that Witch is \u201cnot responsible for\nany content our creators publish on our platform\u201d. Nothing else in the Terms is material.\nAs for Marcela, her success really began in October last year, when she decided to do\na Halloween special. She streamed herself taking a walk through Bishan-Ang Mo Kio\npark at night while using one of Witch\u2019s \u201chorror\u201d paxes to make it seem as if every other\nhuman in the park was some kind of nightly horror \u2014 zombies, werewolves, giants, beasts,\nvampires, and ghosts galore. That stream attracted 50,000 active viewers.\nBut all that was last year. Since then, Marcela has organised her channel around horror\nstreams: night visits to the abandoned Old Changi Hospital, mysterious spots in Pulau\nUbin, etc, all of them enhanced by Witch\u2019s paxes. This has won her dedicated subscriber\nbase amongst Singapore teens aged 14\u201320, who enjoy watching her streams with friends\nat sleepovers and the like.\n AY2022/23-I\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n3\nCapitalising on her success, on 12 August 2022 Marcela planned a huge \u201cSeventh Month\nSpecial\u201d. This coincided with the \ufb01rst day of the Lunar seventh month, a date broadly\nunderstood in Chinese superstition as the day the gates of the Underworld open, allowing\nits denizens to roam the world of the living. Marcela asked Witch if they could make her\na \u201cspecial, extra scary Seventh Month pax which shows extremely realistic ghosts \ufb02ying\neverywhere, so that my subscribers get the fright of their lives\u201d. Witch readily agreed, as it\nwas raring to try out a new AR generation software its engineers had just \ufb01nished building.\nMarcela marketed the event aggressively on her channel, asking her viewers to \u201cinvite all\nyour friends and non-believers to come and witness the true meaning of horror (at your\nown risk!)\u201d.\nMarcela then set herself up on 11 August 2022, 2300 hours, in the middle of Lim Chu\nKang cemetery. Together with her viewers, she counted down to midnight. By 2355\nhours, her stream had upwards of 250,000 viewers (not including those watching through\ntheir friends\u2019 accounts). Once the clock struck twelve, Marcela turned the new pax on.\nWhat transpired was truly the meaning of horror. It turned out that Witch\u2019s engineers had\nbuilt the new software by training a machine learning algorithm on particularly gruesome\nand grisly images \u2014 the sort that would be banned outright from television. This included\nreal images of dead, dismembered, and decaying humans and other (previously) living\nthings. That was how they were able to replicate hyper-realistic, and utterly frightful AR\nvisions. Witch did not realise that paxes created by this software had the potential to repro-\nduce the exact same images on their platform (in hyper-realistic 3D no less). Because of a\ncareless oversight on Witch\u2019s part, the new software did not go through quality assurance\nor censorship before deployment.\nThe moment the \ufb01lter was enabled, gory images in the software\u2019s training data were in-\nstantly broadcast to all of Marcela\u2019s viewers, in\ufb02icting severe distress and emotional dam-\nage. As she was busy \ufb01lming, Marcela did not realise what was happening until a sharp\nfall in viewer count minutes into the stream prompted her to check what they were seeing.\nShe immediately turned the \ufb01lter off when she did.\nBy then, however, the damage had been done. Marcela went from expecting 10,000 new\nsubscribers from that event to losing 250,000 subscribers overnight.\nThis causes her\nmonthly subscriber revenue to plunge by $250,000, as she charges $1/month.

            "**Issue**: Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a duty of care arises when there is a relationship between the parties that gives rise to a reasonable expectation of safety or protection (see Anns v Merton London Borough Council [1978] AC 728).\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Witch and Marcela have a contractual relationship governed by the Terms of Use. Witch's \"creator first\" policy and the fact that they take only a modest amount from subscription fees suggest that their primary concern is to support their creators. However, the Terms also state that Witch is not responsible for any content published on their platform.\n\nMarcela, as a streamer, has a reasonable expectation of safety or protection in terms of the content she publishes and promotes on the platform. She relies on Witch's ability to ensure that the AR filters used by her are safe and suitable for her audience. The fact that Witch agreed to create a special pax for Marcela's \"Seventh Month Special\" suggests that they have a certain level of control over the content being published.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, Witch owes Marcela a duty of care in ensuring that the AR filters used on their platform are safe and suitable for her audience. This duty arises from their contractual relationship and the reasonable expectation of safety or protection that Marcela has as a streamer on the platform.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Anns v Merton London Borough Council [1978] AC 728\n* Singapore Law Reform Commission, \"Report on Tort Law\" (2015)",
            "**Issue**: Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a duty of care arises when there is a relationship between the parties that gives rise to a reasonable expectation of safety or protection (see Anns v Merton London Borough Council [1978] AC 728).\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Witch and Marcela have a contractual relationship established through the Terms of Use. Witch has presented itself as a platform that prioritizes its creators' interests, stating that all subscription fees \"go directly to our content creators\". This creates a reasonable expectation of safety or protection for Marcela, as she relies on Witch's platform to generate revenue and build her fan base.\n\nMoreover, Witch has taken steps to promote Marcela's streams and create a sense of community among its viewers. By agreeing to provide Marcela with a special pax for the Seventh Month Special, Witch has further demonstrated its commitment to supporting its creators' success.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, based on the contractual relationship and the reasonable expectation of safety or protection created by Witch's actions, it can be concluded that Witch owes Marcela a duty of care.",
            "**Issue**: Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a duty of care arises when there is a relationship between the parties that gives rise to a risk of harm to one party if the other party fails to exercise reasonable care. This can be established through a contract or a tortious relationship (Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562).\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Witch and Marcela have a contractual relationship governed by the Terms of Use. Witch provides the platform for Marcela's streams, and Marcela uses the platform to create content and earn revenue. The relationship is shaped by the \"creator first\" policy, which suggests that Witch prioritizes the interests of its creators.\n\nHowever, the relationship between Witch and Marcela is not a traditional employer-employee or principal-agent relationship. Instead, it appears to be a more arms-length agreement where both parties have their own interests and goals. While Witch provides the platform, Marcela has control over her content and can choose how to use the platform's features.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, I conclude that Witch does owe Marcela a duty of care. As a party with a contractual relationship with Marcela, Witch has a responsibility to exercise reasonable care in providing the platform and its services to ensure that they do not cause harm to Marcela or her viewers. This duty arises from the contract between the parties and is governed by the principles of tort law.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562\n* Singapore Law Reform Commission, \"Tort Law in Singapore: A Consultation Paper\" (2014)"

            "**Issue**: Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n\n**Rule**: In Singapore, a duty of care arises when there is a foreseeable risk of harm to another person as a result of the defendant's actions or omissions. The test for determining whether a duty of care exists was established in Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562, which states that a duty of care arises when:\n\n* There is a relationship between the parties\n* The defendant has control over the situation\n* The plaintiff is vulnerable to harm\n* The harm is foreseeable\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Marcela and Witch are both streamers on the AR streaming platform \"Witch\". Marcela's actions as a streamer, such as using the new pax software, may have caused harm to her viewers. Witch, as the platform provider, has control over the content that is published on its platform.\n\nThe relationship between Marcela and her viewers is one of creator-viewer, where Marcela has a responsibility to ensure that the content she creates does not cause harm to her audience. As for Witch, it has a duty to ensure that the content published on its platform does not cause harm to its users.\n\nIn this case, the harm caused by the gory images broadcasted during Marcela's stream was foreseeable and could have been prevented if Witch had implemented proper quality assurance and censorship measures before deploying the new software. Therefore, both Marcela and Witch owe a duty of care to their viewers, including Khan.\n\n**Conclusion**: Yes, both Marcela and Witch owe a duty of care to Khan as their viewer.",

The test for determining whether a duty of care exists was established in Anns v Merton London Borough Council [1978] AC 728, which held that a duty of care will be owed if:\n\n* There is a sufficient relationship of proximity between the parties; and\n* It is fair, just, and reasonable to impose a duty of care.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Marcela's stream was broadcasted on Witch's platform, and the platform allowed her to use AR filters that were created using machine learning algorithms trained on gruesome images. When Marcela enabled the new pax, it broadcasted gory images to all of her viewers, causing severe distress and emotional damage.\n\nWitch owes a duty of care to its users, including Khan, as it has a sufficient relationship of proximity with them. As the platform provider, Witch is responsible for ensuring that the content published on its platform does not cause harm to its users. In this case, Witch's failure to properly quality assure and censor the new software before deployment led to the broadcast of gory images, which caused harm to Marcela's viewers.\n\nMarcela also owes a duty of care to her viewers, including Khan, as she is responsible for the content she publishes on her stream. As a streamer, Marcela has a responsibility to ensure that the content she creates does not cause harm to her audience. In this case, Marcela did not realize what was happening until after the damage had been done, but she still owes a duty of care to her viewers.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, both Witch and Marcela owe Khan a duty of care.",
            "**Issue**: Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n\n**Rule**: In Singapore, the law on duty of care is governed by the principle established in Anns v Merton London Borough Council [1978] AC 728. The Court of Appeal in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for Information and Arts [1996] 1 SLR(R) 222 has further refined this principle. A duty of care arises when:\n\n* There is a relationship between the parties, such as a contractual or fiduciary relationship;\n* The defendant has control over the situation that causes harm to the plaintiff; and\n* It is fair, just, and reasonable to impose a duty of care on the defendant.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Witch and Marcela are both streamers on the AR streaming platform \"Witch\". Witch's Terms of Use state that it is not responsible for any content created by its creators. However, as the platform owner, Witch has control over the software and paxes used on its platform. It can be argued that Witch owes a duty of care to its users, including Khan, to ensure that the content created by streamers does not cause harm.\n\nMarcela, as a streamer, also has a responsibility towards her viewers. She has a contractual relationship with Witch through the Terms of Use and has control over the content she creates. However, Marcela's duty of care is limited to ensuring that her streams do not cause harm to her viewers in the context of her own content creation.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, both Witch and Marcela owe Khan a duty of care. As the platform owner, Witch owes a duty of care to ensure that its software and paxes are safe for use by its users. As a streamer, Marcela owes a duty of care to ensure that her streams do not cause harm to her viewers.\n\nNote: This answer only addresses the issue of whether Witch and Marcela owe Khan a duty of care and does not discuss any defences or the standard of care."

            "**Issue**: Are there any other torts that Marcela can use to sue Witch and/or Marcela besides negligence?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a tort is a civil wrong that causes harm or injury to another person. There are several types of torts recognized in Singapore, including:\n\n* Intentional torts: committed with the intention of causing harm\n* Negligent torts: committed without intent but with reckless disregard for others' safety\n* Strict liability torts: where a defendant is held liable for harm caused by their actions or omissions, regardless of fault\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Marcela can potentially sue Witch and/or Marcela for intentional torts. Specifically:\n\n* Invasion of privacy: Witch's engineers trained the machine learning algorithm on gruesome images without considering the potential impact on viewers' emotional well-being. This could be seen as an invasion of Marcela's subscribers' privacy.\n* Misrepresentation: Marcela marketed the event as a \"Seventh Month Special\" and asked her viewers to \"invite all your friends and non-believers to come and witness the true meaning of horror (at your own risk!)\". Witch agreed to create a special pax, but failed to disclose that it would be broadcasting gory images. This could be seen as misrepresentation.\n* Breach of contract: Marcela's Terms of Use with Witch state that Witch is \"not responsible for any content our creators publish on our platform\". However, Witch's failure to ensure the quality and safety of its paxes could be seen as a breach of this contract.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, besides negligence, Marcela can potentially sue Witch and/or Marcela for intentional torts such as invasion of privacy, misrepresentation, and breach of contract.",

There are several types of torts recognized under Singapore law, including intentional torts, strict liability torts, and vicarious liability.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Marcela may be able to sue Witch and/or Marcela for other torts besides negligence. For instance:\n\n* **Intentional Torts**: Marcela could argue that Witch intentionally caused her harm by deploying the new software without proper quality assurance or censorship, knowing it had the potential to cause severe distress and emotional damage. This could constitute an intentional tort of invasion of privacy or intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n* **Strict Liability Tort**: As a creator on the platform, Marcela may be able to argue that Witch is strictly liable for any harm caused by its actions, including the deployment of the new software. This could be based on the principle of strict liability in tort law, which holds that certain activities are inherently dangerous and should be compensated regardless of fault.\n* **Vicarious Liability**: Marcela may also be able to sue Witch for vicarious liability, arguing that Marcela was acting as an agent or employee of Witch when she used the new software. This could make Witch liable for any harm caused by Marcela's actions.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, besides negligence, Marcela can potentially use intentional torts, strict liability torts, and vicarious liability to sue Witch and/or Marcela for the harm caused by the deployment of the new software.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Singapore Law Reports (SLR) 2019 Vol 1 [Revised Edition] at para 2.01\n* Chan Sek Keong CJ's judgment in Lee Hock Chye v Public Utilities Board [2005] SGCA 34 at [15]\n* Tan Lee Meng J's judgment in Oei Hong Leong v Oei Tjong Wah [1994] SLR(R) 145 at [14-16]",
            "**Issue**: Are there any other torts that Marcela can use to sue Witch and/or Marcela besides negligence?\n\n**Rule**: In Singapore, the law of torts recognizes several types of intentional torts, including:\n\n* Intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED)\n* Invasion of privacy\n* Defamation\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Marcela may be able to sue Witch and/or Marcela for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) due to the careless oversight on Witch's part that led to the broadcast of gory images. The training data used by Witch's engineers was particularly gruesome and grisly, which could be considered an intentional act causing severe distress and emotional damage to Marcela's viewers.\n\nAdditionally, Marcela may also have a claim for invasion of privacy as her subscribers were exposed to disturbing and offensive content without their consent. This could be seen as an unauthorized intrusion into the private lives of her viewers.\n\nFurthermore, Marcela may also have a claim for defamation against Witch and/or Marcela if the gory images broadcast during the stream damaged her reputation or caused harm to her business.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, besides negligence, Marcela can use intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), invasion of privacy, and defamation as torts to sue Witch and/or Marcela."
