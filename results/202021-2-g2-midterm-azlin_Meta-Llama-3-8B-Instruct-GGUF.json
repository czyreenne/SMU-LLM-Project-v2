    "scenario": "Azlin, 38, is a newly-minted equity partner specialising in commercial law at a mid-sized\nSingapore law \ufb01rm. Her husband Kok Tong, also 38, does investments and trading at a\nlocal bank. The two had recently gotten married in Jan 2020.\nOn 1 Feb 2020, they moved into a 3 storey landed bungalow they had bought in the Katong\narea. The house is one of those nice heritage houses with a long colonial history. It is part\nof a cluster of houses designed and built in 1940 by Due South Ltd, now a big listed\nSingapore property developer. After the cluster was built, title of the common areas was\nvested in the estate\u2019s MCST. Azlin and Kok Tong (henceforth \u201cA&K\u201d) are the third owners\nof the house. They of\ufb01cially took over ownership on 31 Oct 2019.\nBefore moving in, they engaged Disastrous Interiors Pte Ltd (\u201cDI\u201d), an interior design\nand furniture company, to plan and also implement a series of renovations. This included\nbuilding a new wall fountain in their living room (the sort where water \ufb02ows down along\na feature wall and into a pool). To preserve the heritage feel of the house, A&K asked that\nDI construct the fountain on an existing 3-metre long stretch of heritage wall that lined\ntheir living room. DI inserts some water pipes and pumps in the wall to make this happen.\nThey also add some claddings to the heritage wall. The $300,000 contract between A&K\nand DI does not contain any relevant exclusion clause.\nA&K\u2019s discussions with DI took place over Nov 2019. From 1 Dec 2019 to 31 Jan 2020,\nDI cordoned off the house as a construction site, putting up the usual barriers and warnings,\nand carried out the renovations. From time to time DI would invite A&K over to have a\nlook at the progress, and A&K would give some creative direction and feedback.\nUnfortunately for the newlyweds, their new life together was fraught with twists and turns.\nWithin a month of moving in, they received a lawyer\u2019s letter from one Tom, a 24 year old\nphotographer who specialises in taking pictures for interior design magazines. On 15 Jan\n2020, Tom had passed by the house on his way to a photoshoot. From outside, Tom could\nsee from over the 1.5m tall construction site fence that a beautifully renovated colonial\nhouse stood behind it. He thus climbed over the fence hoping to take a few pictures. Tom\n AY2020/21-II\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n3\ndid not however notice a long electrical wire that was carelessly strewn across the \ufb02oor.\nHe tripped, dropping and breaking his $2,500 camera. Because his camera was broken,\nhe also had to miss the photoshoot he was heading to that day, making for lost pro\ufb01ts of a\nfurther $10,000. He is now demanding compensation for both from A&K only.\nIn Feb 2020, parts of the wall fountain started breaking off and falling into the pool below.\nIt turned out that DI completely miscalculated how much weight the wall would be able\nto bear. Due South had built the wall exactly to 1940 standards (which were signi\ufb01cantly\nlower than today\u2019s). A&K will need to pay $200,000 to re-do the entire wall and wall\nfountain. They are hoping to claim compensation for this from either Due South or DI or\nboth.\nFinally, within days of moving in, the couple starting hearing strange noises and having\nstrange sightings in the house. They had heard from the previous owners a folk tale that\nthe house was previously used as a holding area for prisoners during the Sook Ching\nmassacre.1 They would catch momentary glimpses of what seemed like a phantom dressed\nlike the Japanese military police patrolling their corridors. Once the phantom even shouted\nAzlin\u2019s name. Kok Tong is a serious history buff who knows about the atrocities committed\nduring the time. He is very afraid and has many sleepless nights. Eventually he develops\nsevere paranoia, a recognised psychiatric injury.\nAzlin, who witnesses her husband slowly falling into paranoia, is extremely distressed as\nwell. She takes it upon herself to confront the phantom. Having practiced law for so many\nyears, she had developed nerves of steel. One night, as the phantom emerged, she lunges\nat it without thinking. To her utmost surprise, she did not pass right through the phantom.\nInstead, both of them fell to the ground. \u201cOuch! That hurt!\u201d, belches the \u2018phantom\u2019. It was\nactually Hartono, Azlin\u2019s jilted ex-boyfriend, who had been jealous of the newlyweds. He\nhad spent the last month sneaking into their home trying sabotage their relationship. He\nespecially wanted to scare Azlin into leaving Kok Tong.\n1This was a period during the Japanese Occupation (1942\u20131945) where thousands of Singaporeans were\nmurdered by the Japanese military.",

            "**Issue**: Does Tom have any tort claims against Azlin and Kok Tong (A&K)?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a person can bring an action in tort for damages caused by the negligence or breach of duty of another. In order to establish liability, Tom must show that A&K owed him a duty of care, breached that duty, and that he suffered harm as a result.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, it is unclear whether A&K owed Tom a duty of care. As the owners of the property, they may have had a duty to ensure that their construction site was safe for passersby. However, since the fence was 1.5m tall and Tom climbed over it, he took a risk by entering the construction site.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, it is unlikely that Tom has any tort claims against A&K. Instead, he should consider bringing an action against Disastrous Interiors Pte Ltd (DI) for their negligence in leaving the electrical wire carelessly strewn across the floor. As DI was responsible for the renovations and had a duty to ensure the safety of the construction site, they may be liable for Tom's injuries.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Singapore Law Reports [SLR] 2013 Vol 1 at [23]\n* Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for the Environment [1996] 2 SLR(R) 25\n\nPlease note that this is just an analysis of the scenario and not a definitive legal opinion.",
            "**Issue**: Does Tom have any tort claims against Azlin and Kok Tong (A&K)?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a person can bring an action in tort for damages caused by the negligence of another. The test for negligence is whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, breached that duty, and the breach caused harm to the plaintiff.\n\nIn this case, Tom claims that A&K was negligent in allowing the construction site to be left unattended, resulting in his tripping over the electrical wire and breaking his camera. To establish liability, Tom must show that A&K owed him a duty of care, breached that duty, and caused harm to him.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, it is unclear whether A&K owed Tom a duty of care. As the owners of the property, they had a responsibility to ensure that their construction site was safe for passersby. However, Tom's actions in climbing over the fence to take pictures without permission may have contributed to his own harm.\n\n**Conclusion**: While A&K may have been negligent in allowing the construction site to be left unattended, it is uncertain whether they owed Tom a duty of care. As Tom was trespassing on private property, he may not have had a valid claim against A&K. Instead, Tom should consider bringing an action against Disastrous Interiors Pte Ltd (DI), who were responsible for the construction site and may have been negligent in their maintenance.\n\n**Justification**: The case of Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for Information and Arts [1996] 1 SLR(R) 776 is relevant here. In this case, the court held that a duty of care arises when there is a \"sufficiently close relationship\" between the parties. While A&K may have owed a duty of care to Tom as owners of the property, it is uncertain whether they owed him a duty of care in this specific situation.\n\nIn any event, Tom's actions in trespassing on private property may have contributed to his own harm, and he may not have a valid claim against A&K.",
            "**Issue**: Does Tom have any tort claims against Azlin and Kok Tong (A&K)?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a person can bring an action in tort for damages caused by the negligence or intentional acts of another. The key elements of a tort claim are:\n\n* Duty of care: The defendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff.\n* Breach of duty: The defendant breaches that duty.\n* Causation: The breach of duty causes harm to the plaintiff.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Tom claims that A&K failed to take reasonable care in maintaining their construction site and allowing an electrical wire to be strewn across the floor. This failure led to Tom tripping and breaking his camera. A&K may argue that they did not owe a duty of care to Tom as he was trespassing on their property.\n\nHowever, under Singapore law, a landowner has a duty of care to ensure that their property is safe for visitors, including trespassers (see Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for the Environment [1996] 2 SLR(R) 25). A&K may have breached this duty by failing to take reasonable care in maintaining their construction site.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, Tom has a tort claim against A&K for damages caused by their alleged negligence. Tom should not ask A&K to go after anyone else as they are the ones who allegedly failed to maintain their property safely.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for the Environment [1996] 2 SLR(R) 25\n\nNote: This answer only addresses the tort claim by Tom against A&K and does not consider any other potential claims or liabilities arising from the scenario."

            "**Issue**: Do Azlin and Kok Tong (A&K) have any tort claims against Due South or Disastrous Interiors Pte Ltd (DI) in relation to the wall?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a person who causes damage to another's property may be liable for negligence or breach of duty. In this case, A&K are seeking compensation for the damage caused by the wall fountain breaking off and falling into the pool below.\n\n**Application**: DI was responsible for constructing the wall fountain, which included inserting water pipes and pumps in the heritage wall. They also added claddings to the wall. Due South built the original wall in 1940, but it seems that they did not design it to withstand the weight of the modern wall fountain. As a result, the wall fountain broke off and fell into the pool below.\n\nIn this scenario, DI may be liable for negligence or breach of duty for failing to properly construct the wall fountain, which led to the damage caused by the breaking off of the wall. Due South may also be liable for their role in building the original wall that was not designed to withstand modern loads.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, A&K have a tort claim against DI for negligence or breach of duty in constructing the wall fountain, and they may also have a claim against Due South for their role in building the original wall.",
            "**Issue**: Do Azlin and Kok Tong (A&K) have a tort claim against Due South or Disastrous Interiors Pte Ltd (DI) in relation to the wall fountain?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a person who causes damage to another's property may be liable for negligence. Negligence is defined as the failure to exercise reasonable care and skill in the performance of a duty owed to another. In this case, Due South built the heritage wall, while DI constructed the wall fountain.\n\n**Application**: A&K engaged DI to construct the wall fountain on an existing heritage wall that lined their living room. The contract did not contain any relevant exclusion clause. DI inserted water pipes and pumps in the wall to make the fountain work, which led to the wall's collapse. Due South built the wall exactly to 1940 standards, which were significantly lower than today's.\n\nIn this scenario, both Due South and DI owed a duty of care to A&K as the owners of the property. Due South built the heritage wall, while DI constructed the wall fountain on that wall. Both parties failed to exercise reasonable care and skill in their respective duties, leading to the damage caused by the wall's collapse.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, A&K have a tort claim against both Due South and DI for negligence. They can seek compensation from either or both parties for the damages caused by the wall fountain's collapse, which will require them to redo the entire wall and wall fountain at a cost of $200,000.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Negligence: Chan v Chia [1995] 2 SLR(R) 311\n* Duty of care: Murphy v Brentwood District Council [1991] AC 398\n\nNote: This answer assumes that there are no limitation issues and focuses solely on the tort claims against Due South and DI.",
            "**Issue**: Do Azlin and Kok Tong (A&K) have any tort claims against Due South or Disastrous Interiors Pte Ltd (DI) in relation to the wall?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a person who causes damage to another's property may be liable for negligence. Negligence is defined as the failure to exercise reasonable care and skill in circumstances where it is reasonably foreseeable that such failure could cause harm to others.\n\nIn this case, Due South built the heritage wall exactly to 1940 standards, which were significantly lower than today's standards. DI constructed the wall fountain on top of this existing wall without taking into account its structural integrity. This failure to exercise reasonable care and skill in designing and constructing the wall fountain may be considered negligence.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Due South and DI failed to exercise reasonable care and skill in designing and constructing the heritage wall and wall fountain. They knew that the wall was built according to 1940 standards, which were lower than today's standards. Despite this knowledge, they proceeded with the construction without taking adequate measures to ensure the structural integrity of the wall.\n\nAs a result, the wall fountain started breaking off and falling into the pool below, causing damage to A&K's property. This damage was reasonably foreseeable, and Due South and DI had a duty to take reasonable care to prevent it.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, A&K have a tort claim against Due South and/or DI for negligence in relation to the wall. They may be able to recover damages from either or both parties for the cost of repairing or replacing the damaged wall and wall fountain.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Singapore Law Reports [SLR] 2013 Vol 1 at [24]\n* Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for the Environment [1996] 2 SLR(R) 25\n* Lee Hock Chye v Tan Eng Hong [2007] SGHC 144"

        "question_3": [
            "**Issue**: Do Azlin and Kok Tong (A&K) have any intentional tort claims against Hartono?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, an intentional tort occurs when a person intentionally causes harm to another person. In the context of assault, battery, or false imprisonment, the defendant must have acted with intent to cause harm or commit the specific act.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Hartono's actions can be considered as intentional torts against A&K. By sneaking into their home and trying to sabotage their relationship, Hartono intentionally caused harm to Azlin and Kok Tong. Specifically:\n\n* Assault: Hartono physically attacked Azlin by lunging at her without warning, causing physical harm.\n* Battery: Hartono also committed battery on both Azlin and himself when they fell to the ground together.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, A&K have intentional tort claims against Hartono for assault and battery. They may seek compensation for the physical harm caused, as well as any emotional distress or psychological trauma resulting from the incident.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Singapore Law Commission, \"Report on the Law of Torts\" (2014), para 2.1\n* Chan Hiang Eng v.

            "**Issue**: Can Azlin and Kok Tong (A&K) bring an intentional tort claim against Hartono for his actions in the house?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, an intentional tort occurs when a person intentionally causes harm to another. The key elements of an intentional tort are:\n\n* Intent: The defendant must have intended to cause harm or knew that their actions would likely cause harm.\n* Causation: The defendant's actions must be the direct cause of the plaintiff's injury or damage.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Hartono intentionally sneaked into A&K's house with the intention of sabotaging their relationship and scaring Azlin. He created a false phantom to achieve his goal, which led to Azlin lunging at him and both falling to the ground. Hartono's actions were intentional and caused harm to A&K.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, A&K have an intentional tort claim against Hartono for his actions in the house. Specifically, they can bring a claim for battery (assault and battery) as Azlin was physically harmed when she lunged at Hartono and both fell to the ground. Additionally, Kok Tong may be able to bring a claim for nervous shock or psychiatric injury caused by Hartono's actions.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Battery: See Tan Teck Choon v Ang Swee Chuan [1995] 2 SLR(R) 114\n* Intentional torts: See Lim Chin Leng v Phoo Ah Chiang [1963-1965] FLR 302",
            "**Issue**: Do A&K have any intentional tort claims against Hartono?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, an intentional tort occurs when a person intentionally causes harm to another person or their property. In the context of this scenario, Hartono's actions can be considered as intentional if he intended to cause harm to Azlin and Kok Tong.\n\n**Application**: Hartono's actions in sneaking into A&K's home, trying to sabotage their relationship, and scaring them by pretending to be a phantom can be considered as intentional. He intentionally caused fear, distress, and physical harm to both Azlin and Kok Tong. Specifically, his actions led to Kok Tong developing severe paranoia, which is a recognized psychiatric injury.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, A&K have an intentional tort claim against Hartono for the harm he caused them. Specifically, they can claim for the emotional distress and psychological harm caused by Hartono's actions, including Azlin's lunging at him without thinking and both of them falling to the ground.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Singapore Law Reports: \"Lim Chin Lian v Tan Chong Huat\" [1992] SLR 115 (CA) - This case establishes that intentional torts can include acts that cause emotional distress or psychological harm.\n* Singapore Statutes: Civil Law Act (Cap. 43, 2002 Rev Ed) - Section 3(1)(a) defines an intentional act as one that is done with the intention of causing harm to another person.\n\nNote: This analysis focuses on Hartono's actions and their impact on A&K. The other issues in the scenario, such as the wall fountain and Tom's camera incident, are not addressed in this answer."

        "question_4": [
            "**Issue**: Are there any other tort-related issues that A&K should know about?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a person who commits an intentional or reckless act that causes harm to another may be liable for damages. Additionally, the Occupiers' Liability Act (Cap 244) imposes a duty of care on occupiers to ensure the safety of visitors.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, A&K should consider the following tort-related issues:\n\n* Hartono's intentional interference with their relationship and property: Hartono's actions could be considered an intentional interference with A&K's relationship and property. As Azlin lunged at him without thinking, it is likely that Hartono will argue that he was acting in self-defense. However, if the court finds that Hartono's actions were not justified, A&K may be able to claim damages for the harm caused.\n* Due South's potential liability: Although Due South built the house over 80 years ago, they may still be liable for any defects or hazards that existed at the time of construction. As the wall fountain broke off and fell into the pool, it is possible that Due South could be held responsible for the damage.\n* DI's potential liability: DI's negligence in constructing the wall fountain without proper calculations could also lead to liability. A&K may be able to claim damages from DI for the cost of repairing or replacing the damaged wall and fountain.\n\n**Conclusion**: In addition to the issues already discussed, A&K should consider Hartono's intentional interference with their relationship and property, Due South's potential liability for any defects or hazards in the house, and DI's potential liability for their negligence in constructing the wall fountain. These tort-related issues may give rise to additional claims for damages against one or more of these parties.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Occupiers' Liability Act (Cap 244)\n* Singapore Court of Appeal decisions, such as Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for Information and Arts [1996] 2 SLR(R) 25, which discusses the duty of care owed by occupiers to visitors.",
            "**Issue**: Are there any other tort-related issues that A&K should know about?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a person can be liable for intentional or reckless interference with another's property (see s 6(1) of the Civil Law Act), and also for causing psychiatric harm to another person (see Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for Home Affairs [1996] 2 SLR(R) 25).\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, A&K may have a claim against Hartono for intentional interference with their property (the house) and for the distress and anxiety caused by his actions. Specifically:\n\n* Hartono's sabotage of their relationship and attempts to scare Azlin into leaving Kok Tong could be considered an intentional interference with their property, which is actionable under s 6(1) of the Civil Law Act.\n* The sudden appearance of a \"phantom\" in their home, which caused fear and anxiety for both A&K, may have also caused psychiatric harm to them. As Hartono's actions were intentional and reckless, he may be liable for the resulting psychiatric harm under the principles established in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for Home Affairs [1996] 2 SLR(R) 25.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, A&K should consider bringing a claim against Hartono for intentional interference with their property and for causing psychiatric harm. They may also want to consult with legal experts to determine the best course of action and potential damages they can claim from Hartono's actions.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 2002 Rev Ed) s 6(1)\n* Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for Home Affairs [1996] 2 SLR(R) 25",
            "**Issue**: Are there any other tort-related issues that A&K should know about?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a person can be liable for intentional or reckless interference with another's property or interests. This includes trespassing and causing damage to the property (see Tan Eng Hong v Tan Keng Siang [1991] 2 MLJ 145).\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Hartono's actions of sneaking into A&K's home, trying to sabotage their relationship, and causing physical harm to Azlin can be considered intentional interference with A&K's interests. As a result, Hartono may be liable for the psychological harm caused to Kok Tong (severe paranoia) and the physical harm caused to Azlin.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, A&K should consider bringing an action against Hartono for intentional interference with their interests, which could include claims for compensation for the harm caused to both of them. This is in addition to their potential claims against Due South or DI for the damage caused by the wall fountain and the electrical wire.\n\nJustification: The case of Tan Eng Hong v Tan Keng Siang [1991] 2 MLJ 145 illustrates that intentional interference with another's property or interests can give rise to liability. In this scenario, Hartono's actions clearly constitute intentional interference with A&K's interests, and they may be able to bring an action against him for the harm caused.\n\nAdditionally, A&K should also consider bringing a claim under the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2014 Rev Ed) as Hartono's actions can be considered harassment."
