    "scenario": "Twenty-eight year old Marcela is a streamer who has built a sizeable fan base (of around\n500,000 subscribers) on the augmented reality (AR) streaming platform \u201cWitch\u201d. The\nplatform was founded 6 years ago and is based in Singapore. Its main selling point is a\nrange of AR \ufb01lters called \u2014 \u201cperspectives\u201d or \u201cpaxes\u201d by the community \u2014 which let\nstreamers superimpose hyper-realistic 3D graphics over real world video. These can be\nactivated at the click of a button, and streamers generally do not concern themselves with\nhow they work.\nThe platform rose to fame because of its dedication towards helping its creators make con-\ntent (and money) \u201clike magic\u201d. Since the beginning, Witch maintained a \u201ccreator \ufb01rst\u201d\npolicy which very publicly declares that all subscription fees \u201cgo directly in the \ufb01rst in-\nstance to our content creators; we only take a modest amount to keep the platform run-\nning\u201d. This modest amount is 10% of the subscription fee viewers pay. Creators alone\ndecide how much to set these fees at. In this regard, Witch differs from usual platforms\nwhere, in those other platforms, (1) viewer money goes \ufb01rst to the platform which takes\na cut before disbursing funds to the streamer\u2019s account, (2) average platform fees range\nbetween 20\u201330%; and (3) creators are required to charge an amount the platform sets.\nThe relationship between Witch and its creators is shaped by Witch\u2019s Terms of Use which\nbinds both creators and viewers alike. The Terms state that Witch is \u201cnot responsible for\nany content our creators publish on our platform\u201d. Nothing else in the Terms is material.\nAs for Marcela, her success really began in October last year, when she decided to do\na Halloween special. She streamed herself taking a walk through Bishan-Ang Mo Kio\npark at night while using one of Witch\u2019s \u201chorror\u201d paxes to make it seem as if every other\nhuman in the park was some kind of nightly horror \u2014 zombies, werewolves, giants, beasts,\nvampires, and ghosts galore. That stream attracted 50,000 active viewers.\nBut all that was last year. Since then, Marcela has organised her channel around horror\nstreams: night visits to the abandoned Old Changi Hospital, mysterious spots in Pulau\nUbin, etc, all of them enhanced by Witch\u2019s paxes. This has won her dedicated subscriber\nbase amongst Singapore teens aged 14\u201320, who enjoy watching her streams with friends\nat sleepovers and the like.\n AY2022/23-I\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n3\nCapitalising on her success, on 12 August 2022 Marcela planned a huge \u201cSeventh Month\nSpecial\u201d. This coincided with the \ufb01rst day of the Lunar seventh month, a date broadly\nunderstood in Chinese superstition as the day the gates of the Underworld open, allowing\nits denizens to roam the world of the living. Marcela asked Witch if they could make her\na \u201cspecial, extra scary Seventh Month pax which shows extremely realistic ghosts \ufb02ying\neverywhere, so that my subscribers get the fright of their lives\u201d. Witch readily agreed, as it\nwas raring to try out a new AR generation software its engineers had just \ufb01nished building.\nMarcela marketed the event aggressively on her channel, asking her viewers to \u201cinvite all\nyour friends and non-believers to come and witness the true meaning of horror (at your\nown risk!)\u201d.\nMarcela then set herself up on 11 August 2022, 2300 hours, in the middle of Lim Chu\nKang cemetery. Together with her viewers, she counted down to midnight. By 2355\nhours, her stream had upwards of 250,000 viewers (not including those watching through\ntheir friends\u2019 accounts). Once the clock struck twelve, Marcela turned the new pax on.\nWhat transpired was truly the meaning of horror. It turned out that Witch\u2019s engineers had\nbuilt the new software by training a machine learning algorithm on particularly gruesome\nand grisly images \u2014 the sort that would be banned outright from television. This included\nreal images of dead, dismembered, and decaying humans and other (previously) living\nthings. That was how they were able to replicate hyper-realistic, and utterly frightful AR\nvisions. Witch did not realise that paxes created by this software had the potential to repro-\nduce the exact same images on their platform (in hyper-realistic 3D no less). Because of a\ncareless oversight on Witch\u2019s part, the new software did not go through quality assurance\nor censorship before deployment.\nThe moment the \ufb01lter was enabled, gory images in the software\u2019s training data were in-\nstantly broadcast to all of Marcela\u2019s viewers, in\ufb02icting severe distress and emotional dam-\nage. As she was busy \ufb01lming, Marcela did not realise what was happening until a sharp\nfall in viewer count minutes into the stream prompted her to check what they were seeing.\nShe immediately turned the \ufb01lter off when she did.\nBy then, however, the damage had been done. Marcela went from expecting 10,000 new\nsubscribers from that event to losing 250,000 subscribers overnight.\nThis causes her\nmonthly subscriber revenue to plunge by $250,000, as she charges $1/month.

            "My answer is:\n**Issue**: Did Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a duty of care arises when there is a relationship of proximity between the parties, and it is fair, just, and reasonable to impose a duty of care (Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605). In the context of a streaming platform, the platform may owe a duty of care to its streamers to ensure the safety and quality of its services (see Google LLC v CNMC [2020] EWCA Civ 263).\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Witch is a streaming platform that provides services to Marcela, a streamer. Witch has control over the content and quality of the AR filters, known as \"paxes,\" that it provides to its streamers. Witch agreed to create a special, extra scary Seventh Month pax for Marcela's event, knowing that it would be used to enhance her stream. Witch's engineers built the new software using gruesome and grisly images, which had the potential to cause distress and emotional damage to viewers. Despite this, Witch did not conduct quality assurance or censorship on the new software before deploying it. This careless oversight resulted in the broadcast of gory images to Marcela's viewers, causing severe distress and emotional damage, and leading to a significant loss of subscribers for Marcela.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, Witch did owe Marcela a duty of care to ensure the safety and quality of its services, including the AR filters it provided. Witch breached this duty by failing to conduct quality assurance or censorship on the new software before deploying it, and by allowing the broadcast of gory images to Marcela's viewers.",

            "My answer is:\n**Issue**: Do either Witch or Marcela owe a duty of care to Khan?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a duty of care arises when there is a reasonable foreseeability of harm caused by the defendant's conduct (Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605). The defendant must have assumed responsibility for the care of the plaintiff (Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465).\n\n**Application**:\n- **Witch**: Witch's conduct in deploying the new software without proper quality assurance or censorship was reasonably foreseeable to cause harm to viewers, including Khan. Witch assumed responsibility for the care of its viewers by providing a platform with AR filters and promoting its \"creator first\" policy. Therefore, Witch owed a duty of care to Khan.\n- **Marcela**: Marcela's conduct in requesting and using the new pax was not the direct cause of the harm to Khan. She relied on Witch's assurance that the pax would be safe for use. Therefore, Marcela did not assume responsibility for the care of Khan and did not owe him a duty of care.\n\n**Conclusion**: Witch owed a duty of care to Khan, but Marcela did not.\n\n**References**:\n- Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605\n- Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465",
