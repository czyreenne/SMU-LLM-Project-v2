    "scenario": "Aisya, 38, is a newly-minted equity partner specialising in commercial law at a mid-sized\nSingapore law \ufb01rm. Her husband Kwan, also 38, does investments and trading at a local\nbank. The two had recently gotten married in Jan 2020.\nOn 1 Feb 2020, they moved into a 3 storey landed bungalow they had bought in the Katong\narea. The house is one of those nice heritage houses with a long colonial history. It\nwas designed and built in 1940 by Due South Ltd, now a big listed Singapore property\ndeveloper. Aisya and Kwan (henceforth \u201cA&K\u201d) are the \ufb01fth owners of the house. They\nof\ufb01cially took over ownership on 31 Oct 2019.\nBefore moving in, they engaged Safe Interiors Pte Ltd (\u201cSI\u201d), an interior design and furni-\nture company, to plan and also implement a series of renovations. This included building\na new wall fountain in their living room (the sort where water \ufb02ows down along a fea-\nture wall and into a pool). To preserve the heritage feel of the house, A&K asked that SI\nconstruct the fountain on an existing 3-metre long stretch of heritage wall that lined their\nliving room. SI inserts some water pipes and pumps in the wall to make this happen. They\nalso add some claddings to the heritage wall. The $200,000 contract between A&K and\nSI does not contain any relevant exclusion clause.\nA&K\u2019s discussions with SI took place over Nov 2019. From 1 Dec 2019 to 31 Jan 2020, SI\ncordoned off the house as a construction site, putting up the usual barriers and warnings,\nand carried out the renovations. From time to time SI would invite A&K over to have a\nlook at the progress, and A&K would give some creative direction and feedback.\nUnfortunately for the newlyweds, their new life together was fraught with twists and turns.\nWithin a month of moving in, they received a lawyer\u2019s letter from one Tommy, a 24 year\nold photographer who specialises in taking pictures for interior design magazines. On\n15 Jan 2020, SI had closed but forgotten to lock the construction site gate. The wind\nwas very strong that day and so blew the gate ajar. Passing by outside, Tommy spied a\nbeautifully renovated colonial house and ventured in to take a few pictures. Tommy did\nnot however notice a long electrical wire that was carelessly strewn across the \ufb02oor. He\n AY2020/21-II\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n3\ntripped, dropping and breaking his $10,000 camera. Because his camera was broken, he\nalso had to miss the photoshoot he was heading to that day, making for lost pro\ufb01ts of a\nfurther $25,000. He is now demanding compensation for both from A&K only.\nAround Feb 2020, parts of the wall fountain started breaking off and falling into the pool\nbelow. It turned out that the original heritage wall as designed and built by Due South was\ndefective. The result is that it would easily disintegrate if some weight was placed on it.\nThere was nothing wrong with SI\u2019s fountain or the materials they used. But because A&K\nhad speci\ufb01cally asked for the fountain to be built on that wall, SI did not check whether\nthe wall was suitable for a wall fountain to begin with. A&K will need to pay $100,000\nto re-do the entire wall and wall fountain. They are hoping to claim compensation for this\nfrom either Due South or SI or both.\nFinally, within days of moving in, the couple starting hearing strange noises and having\nstrange sightings in the house. They had heard from the previous owners a folk tale that\nthe house was previously used as a holding area for prisoners during the Sook Ching\nmassacre.1 They would catch momentary glimpses of what seemed like a phantom dressed\nlike the Japanese military police patrolling their corridors. Once the phantom even shouted\nKwan\u2019s name. Kwan is a serious history buff who knows about the atrocities committed\nduring the time. He is very afraid and has many sleepless nights. Eventually he develops\nsevere paranoia, a recognised psychiatric injury.\nAisya, who witnesses her husband slowly falling into paranoia, is extremely distressed as\nwell. She takes it upon herself to confront the phantom. Having practiced law for so many\nyears, she had developed nerves of steel. One night, as the phantom emerged, she lunges\nat it without thinking. To her utmost surprise, she did not pass right through the phantom.\nInstead, both of them fell to the ground. \u201cOuch! That hurt!\u201d, belches the \u2018phantom\u2019. It\nwas actually Harto, Aisya\u2019s jilted ex-boyfriend, who had been jealous of the newlyweds.\nHe had spent the last month sneaking into their home trying sabotage their relationship.\nHe especially wanted to scare Kwan into leaving Aisya.\n1This was a period during the Japanese Occupation (1942\u20131945) where thousands of Singaporeans were\nmurdered by the Japanese military.",

            "My answer is:\n**Issue**: Did A&K owe a duty of care to Tommy?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a duty of care arises when the defendant has control over the premises and the plaintiff is a foreseeable visitor to those premises. (See *Occupiers' Liability Act (Cap 222)* and *Lee Ee Lan v. Singapore Telecommunications Ltd [2009] 3 SLR 1029*)\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, A&K had control over the premises as the occupiers. Tommy was a foreseeable visitor as he was a photographer who often took pictures of interior design magazines. However, Tommy was a trespasser as he entered the premises without A&K's permission. In Singapore, occupiers do not owe a duty of care to trespassers unless they knew or ought to have known of the trespasser's presence and the risk of injury (*Occupiers' Liability Act (Cap 222)*). Here, A&K did not know or ought to have known of Tommy's presence as they had left the gate unlocked but had no reason to believe that someone would enter their premises.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, A&K did not owe a duty of care to Tommy and are not liable for his damages. Tommy should ask SI to compensate him for his losses as SI was responsible for the electrical wire that caused his fall.\n\n**Issue**: Did SI owe a duty of care to Tommy?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, an occupier of premises owes a duty of care to all visitors, including lawful visitors and trespassers, to take reasonable care to ensure that the visitor is reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which the visitor is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there (*Occupiers' Liability Act (Cap 222)*).\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, SI was an occupier of the premises as they were carrying out renovations.
