    "scenario": "Twenty-eight year old Marcela is a streamer who has built a sizeable fan base (of around\n500,000 subscribers) on the augmented reality (AR) streaming platform \u201cWitch\u201d. The\nplatform was founded 6 years ago and is based in Singapore. Its main selling point is a\nrange of AR \ufb01lters called \u2014 \u201cperspectives\u201d or \u201cpaxes\u201d by the community \u2014 which let\nstreamers superimpose hyper-realistic 3D graphics over real world video. These can be\nactivated at the click of a button, and streamers generally do not concern themselves with\nhow they work.\nThe platform rose to fame because of its dedication towards helping its creators make con-\ntent (and money) \u201clike magic\u201d. Since the beginning, Witch maintained a \u201ccreator \ufb01rst\u201d\npolicy which very publicly declares that all subscription fees \u201cgo directly in the \ufb01rst in-\nstance to our content creators; we only take a modest amount to keep the platform run-\nning\u201d. This modest amount is 10% of the subscription fee viewers pay. Creators alone\ndecide how much to set these fees at. In this regard, Witch differs from usual platforms\nwhere, in those other platforms, (1) viewer money goes \ufb01rst to the platform which takes\na cut before disbursing funds to the streamer\u2019s account, (2) average platform fees range\nbetween 20\u201330%; and (3) creators are required to charge an amount the platform sets.\nThe relationship between Witch and its creators is shaped by Witch\u2019s Terms of Use which\nbinds both creators and viewers alike. The Terms state that Witch is \u201cnot responsible for\nany content our creators publish on our platform\u201d. Nothing else in the Terms is material.\nAs for Marcela, her success really began in October last year, when she decided to do\na Halloween special. She streamed herself taking a walk through Bishan-Ang Mo Kio\npark at night while using one of Witch\u2019s \u201chorror\u201d paxes to make it seem as if every other\nhuman in the park was some kind of nightly horror \u2014 zombies, werewolves, giants, beasts,\nvampires, and ghosts galore. That stream attracted 50,000 active viewers.\nBut all that was last year. Since then, Marcela has organised her channel around horror\nstreams: night visits to the abandoned Old Changi Hospital, mysterious spots in Pulau\nUbin, etc, all of them enhanced by Witch\u2019s paxes. This has won her dedicated subscriber\nbase amongst Singapore teens aged 14\u201320, who enjoy watching her streams with friends\nat sleepovers and the like.\n AY2022/23-I\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n3\nCapitalising on her success, on 12 August 2022 Marcela planned a huge \u201cSeventh Month\nSpecial\u201d. This coincided with the \ufb01rst day of the Lunar seventh month, a date broadly\nunderstood in Chinese superstition as the day the gates of the Underworld open, allowing\nits denizens to roam the world of the living. Marcela asked Witch if they could make her\na \u201cspecial, extra scary Seventh Month pax which shows extremely realistic ghosts \ufb02ying\neverywhere, so that my subscribers get the fright of their lives\u201d. Witch readily agreed, as it\nwas raring to try out a new AR generation software its engineers had just \ufb01nished building.\nMarcela marketed the event aggressively on her channel, asking her viewers to \u201cinvite all\nyour friends and non-believers to come and witness the true meaning of horror (at your\nown risk!)\u201d.\nMarcela then set herself up on 11 August 2022, 2300 hours, in the middle of Lim Chu\nKang cemetery. Together with her viewers, she counted down to midnight. By 2355\nhours, her stream had upwards of 250,000 viewers (not including those watching through\ntheir friends\u2019 accounts). Once the clock struck twelve, Marcela turned the new pax on.\nWhat transpired was truly the meaning of horror. It turned out that Witch\u2019s engineers had\nbuilt the new software by training a machine learning algorithm on particularly gruesome\nand grisly images \u2014 the sort that would be banned outright from television. This included\nreal images of dead, dismembered, and decaying humans and other (previously) living\nthings. That was how they were able to replicate hyper-realistic, and utterly frightful AR\nvisions. Witch did not realise that paxes created by this software had the potential to repro-\nduce the exact same images on their platform (in hyper-realistic 3D no less). Because of a\ncareless oversight on Witch\u2019s part, the new software did not go through quality assurance\nor censorship before deployment.\nThe moment the \ufb01lter was enabled, gory images in the software\u2019s training data were in-\nstantly broadcast to all of Marcela\u2019s viewers, in\ufb02icting severe distress and emotional dam-\nage. As she was busy \ufb01lming, Marcela did not realise what was happening until a sharp\nfall in viewer count minutes into the stream prompted her to check what they were seeing.\nShe immediately turned the \ufb01lter off when she did.\nBy then, however, the damage had been done. Marcela went from expecting 10,000 new\nsubscribers from that event to losing 250,000 subscribers overnight.\nThis causes her\nmonthly subscriber revenue to plunge by $250,000, as she charges $1/month.

Conclusion:**\n\nThis situation raises the question of whether a platform can be held liable for the content created by its users, especially when using AI-generated content.  \n\n**To determine if the platform is liable for Marcela's experience, we need to consider:**\n\n* **The nature of the \"perspectives\"**: The scenario states that Marcela uses the \"persolution\" of the platform to her advantage.\n* **The type of \"horror\" involved**: This detail suggests that the content involves AI-generated content (AR). \n\n**5.

            "Here's how we can analyze this scenario using the IRAC method, focusing on the legal issues and sticking to the information provided:\n\n**Issue**: Does the \"Seventh Month\" event, where Marcela (a streamer) is expected to have viewers share in a \"shared responsibility\" for their own actions?\n\n**Rule**: The concept of \"duty of care\" is a core element of negligence law. A person owes a duty of care to others if they could reasonably foresee that their actions could cause harm to them. \n\n**Application**: This situation presents a unique legal issue regarding the **\"duty of care\"** owed by Marcela and the platform to the viewers. While the engineers' actions may be considered negligent, the question of whether this specific event constitutes a breach of duty is complex.\n\n**Conclusion**:  The \"Seventh Month\" concept is not directly related to the tort of negligence itself, but rather to the legal principle of **negligence liability**. \n\n**Here's how we can break down the potential legal issues:**\n\n**1. The \"Seventh Month\" Rule**: The question of whether Marcela and the platform are liable for a viewer's distress is tied to the concept of **informed consent**. If the \"Seventh Month\" paxes were designed to be used on the platform, and the viewers were aware that they were agreeing to participate in this event by being exposed to potentially disturbing content.\n\n**2. Potential for Harm**: The fact that Marcela's \"Seventh Month\" event was a public event, and she is actively encouraging viewers to use it for its intended purpose (streaming with) suggests that the content itself may be subject to scrutiny. If the platform's policies on content display were clearly explained and agreed upon by the users, then the question of whether they are aware of the potential for harm is crucial in determining liability.\n\n**3. Specifics**: The fact that the \"Seventh Month\" paxes was designed to be used to create a \"frightful\" experience suggests that the specific content of the filter's impact on viewers is important. If the platform's engineers were aware that their software could cause distress, they may have a **duty of care** to consider the potential for harm and ensure the \"Seventh Month\" feature is designed with appropriate safeguards.\n\n**4. Potential for Legal Action**: While the information provided doesn't suggest legal action by Marcela against the viewers, it raises the question of whether the platform or its creators are liable for the consequences of a viewer's actions if they were aware that their actions could be harmful to others.\n\n\nIt is important to note that this scenario only focuses on the facts given and does not include information about the legal context of \"seventh month\" events. \n\n**In this case, it is unclear whether Marcela would have a claim against someone who had a negative reaction to the filter.**\n",
