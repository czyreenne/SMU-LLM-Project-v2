    "scenario": "Azlin, 38, is a newly-minted equity partner specialising in commercial law at a mid-sized\nSingapore law \ufb01rm. Her husband Kok Tong, also 38, does investments and trading at a\nlocal bank. The two had recently gotten married in Jan 2020.\nOn 1 Feb 2020, they moved into a 3 storey landed bungalow they had bought in the Katong\narea. The house is one of those nice heritage houses with a long colonial history. It is part\nof a cluster of houses designed and built in 1940 by Due South Ltd, now a big listed\nSingapore property developer. After the cluster was built, title of the common areas was\nvested in the estate\u2019s MCST. Azlin and Kok Tong (henceforth \u201cA&K\u201d) are the third owners\nof the house. They of\ufb01cially took over ownership on 31 Oct 2019.\nBefore moving in, they engaged Disastrous Interiors Pte Ltd (\u201cDI\u201d), an interior design\nand furniture company, to plan and also implement a series of renovations. This included\nbuilding a new wall fountain in their living room (the sort where water \ufb02ows down along\na feature wall and into a pool). To preserve the heritage feel of the house, A&K asked that\nDI construct the fountain on an existing 3-metre long stretch of heritage wall that lined\ntheir living room. DI inserts some water pipes and pumps in the wall to make this happen.\nThey also add some claddings to the heritage wall. The $300,000 contract between A&K\nand DI does not contain any relevant exclusion clause.\nA&K\u2019s discussions with DI took place over Nov 2019. From 1 Dec 2019 to 31 Jan 2020,\nDI cordoned off the house as a construction site, putting up the usual barriers and warnings,\nand carried out the renovations. From time to time DI would invite A&K over to have a\nlook at the progress, and A&K would give some creative direction and feedback.\nUnfortunately for the newlyweds, their new life together was fraught with twists and turns.\nWithin a month of moving in, they received a lawyer\u2019s letter from one Tom, a 24 year old\nphotographer who specialises in taking pictures for interior design magazines. On 15 Jan\n2020, Tom had passed by the house on his way to a photoshoot. From outside, Tom could\nsee from over the 1.5m tall construction site fence that a beautifully renovated colonial\nhouse stood behind it. He thus climbed over the fence hoping to take a few pictures. Tom\n AY2020/21-II\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n3\ndid not however notice a long electrical wire that was carelessly strewn across the \ufb02oor.\nHe tripped, dropping and breaking his $2,500 camera. Because his camera was broken,\nhe also had to miss the photoshoot he was heading to that day, making for lost pro\ufb01ts of a\nfurther $10,000. He is now demanding compensation for both from A&K only.\nIn Feb 2020, parts of the wall fountain started breaking off and falling into the pool below.\nIt turned out that DI completely miscalculated how much weight the wall would be able\nto bear. Due South had built the wall exactly to 1940 standards (which were signi\ufb01cantly\nlower than today\u2019s). A&K will need to pay $200,000 to re-do the entire wall and wall\nfountain. They are hoping to claim compensation for this from either Due South or DI or\nboth.\nFinally, within days of moving in, the couple starting hearing strange noises and having\nstrange sightings in the house. They had heard from the previous owners a folk tale that\nthe house was previously used as a holding area for prisoners during the Sook Ching\nmassacre.1 They would catch momentary glimpses of what seemed like a phantom dressed\nlike the Japanese military police patrolling their corridors. Once the phantom even shouted\nAzlin\u2019s name. Kok Tong is a serious history buff who knows about the atrocities committed\nduring the time. He is very afraid and has many sleepless nights. Eventually he develops\nsevere paranoia, a recognised psychiatric injury.\nAzlin, who witnesses her husband slowly falling into paranoia, is extremely distressed as\nwell. She takes it upon herself to confront the phantom. Having practiced law for so many\nyears, she had developed nerves of steel. One night, as the phantom emerged, she lunges\nat it without thinking. To her utmost surprise, she did not pass right through the phantom.\nInstead, both of them fell to the ground. \u201cOuch! That hurt!\u201d, belches the \u2018phantom\u2019. It was\nactually Hartono, Azlin\u2019s jilted ex-boyfriend, who had been jealous of the newlyweds. He\nhad spent the last month sneaking into their home trying sabotage their relationship. He\nespecially wanted to scare Azlin into leaving Kok Tong.\n1This was a period during the Japanese Occupation (1942\u20131945) where thousands of Singaporeans were\nmurdered by the Japanese military.",

            "Here's an analysis of the situation presented in the scenario regarding the potential for tort claims:\n\n**1. Does the firm have any grounds for a claim?**\n\n\n**a. Issue**: Does A&K owe a duty of care to a photographer who was injured due to their property being damaged by a third party?\n\n**b. Rule**: In Singapore, there is a legal principle called **\"vicarious liability.\"** This means that someone can be held liable for the actions of another person if they are in a position of authority or responsibility over them. \nIn this case, it's unclear if A&K would be considered to have a legal obligation to ensure the photographer was not injured by their own lack of care.**\n\n**c. Application**:\n\nSince the scenario mentions that A&K is \"a third-party\" and that he \"passed over\" the camera company, it suggests that Due South (the firm) may not be held liable for the photographer's injuries. \n\n**d. Conclusion:**\n\nIt's unlikely that A&K would be directly liable for the damage to the property caused by a third party. However, the situation is complex because of the \"vicarious liability\" aspect.\n\n\n**a. Application**:\n\n**b. Rule**: It's highly likely that **A&K will not be held liable for the damages caused by their own employees** if they were negligent in their work and this was a result of the firm\u2019s failure to properly secure the property as a third party.\n\n**b. Reasoned Reasoning:**\n\n\n1. **Negligence**: If the photographer's injuries were due to Due South's negligence, then he would have a claim against the firm. \n2. **Vicarious Liability**: The question of whether Due South is liable for the camera damage depends on the nature of the injury and the circumstances surrounding it.\n\n**Here's how the concept of vicarious liability might apply to this situation:**\n\n* **If the case involves a breach of the \u2018standard\u2019 exclusion clause**: If the firm had any specific policies or procedures in place to prevent people from being injured by the camera,\nand these were not followed, then they could be held liable for the injury. \n**b.  Since the scenario mentions that Due South is a 'third party' to the situation**, it\u2019s possible that he has a legal claim against them.\n\n**However**: The details of the \u2018Due had been in a holding area\u2019 situation are crucial to this analysis. If A&K was injured due to the firm's negligence, then they would have grounds for a claim. \n\n**d. Potential Issues**:\n\nThe following factors will be important in determining if Due South is liable:\n\n\n* **Did the firm make any assurances about the safety of the fountain?** If they promised to fix it or maintain its safety and accessibility",
            "Here's an analysis of the situation for a potential lawsuit involving Due South (the listed MCST company)\n\n**1. Does the photographer have any tort claims against A&K?**\n\nThis scenario sets up several potential tort claims, but it's unclear if they would be successful in court. Here's why:\n\n\n**a. Issue**: **Negligence**. \n\nThe key question is whether Due South Ltd., the company that built the wall, owed a duty of care to the photographer (who we assume is an individual for this scenario).\n\n**b. Rule**: In Singapore law, a duty of care exists when there's a relationship where one party owes a duty to take reasonable care for another party's safety or well-being. This duty of care can be implied in certain situations, such as the case of a property owner who has a responsibility to ensure their property is safe for visitors.\n\n**c. Application**: In this case, A&B are likely to have been liable for any injuries sustained due to the lack of safety on the construction site. \n\n**b. Analysis**:  The photographer claims he was injured by the \u2018beautiful\u2019 but dangerous wall. This implies that the injury occurred due to a defect in the property. While the question doesn't specify the type of fountain, we can assume it involves some form of water feature which requires careful maintenance and design to prevent accidents.\n\n**d. Should the photographer be able to sue for his injuries?**\n\n\n**2. Potential Tort Claims**:\n\n* **Negligence**: The most likely claim is negligence. If the \u2018sabotage\u2019 was a direct result of Due South's actions (i.e., they were negligent in their construction work), then there may be an argument that A&B are liable for the injuries caused by the faulty fountain. \n\n* **Premises Liability**: Depending on the circumstances, the nature of the \u2018lost profits\u2019 claim against the third-party contractor might be a claim for negligence. The photographer's claim against the house owners (the 'third party') would likely be based on the details of the contract and the extent to which the owners were aware of the potential dangers.\n\n**e. Conclusion**:\n\nIt is important to note that the \u2018Due Diligence\u2019 requirement in this case may be a difficult hurdle for the photographer to overcome.

            "## Analysis of Potential Tort Claims (Based on the Provided Information)\n\n**Based on the scenario provided, we can see that there are potential tort claims against both Due South Ltd. and Azlin's husband.**\n\n**Issue**: Can A&K sue the photographer for the damage to their home caused by the photographer\u2019s actions?\n\n**Rule**: Yes, but only if they can prove negligence on the part of the photographer. \n\n**Applying the information to the scenario**:\n\n* **The \u2018Due Diligence\u2019 Exclusion**: The fact that the contract does not contain any exclusion clause regarding the wall is crucial. If something in the contract explicitly excludes liability for the camera-related issues, then A&K would have no claim against the photographer. \n* **Negligence**: Since the contract with the contractor doesn't include an exclusion clause about the damage to their home, A&K could potentially argue that the company failed to take reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of their home during the renovation process. This could include failing to properly secure the area for construction activities, leading to the \"Jilted Boyfriend\" scenario.**\n\n**Reasoning**:\n\n* **Limited Liability**: The fact that the \u2018A&K\u2019s\u2019 new bungalow is a historical landmark and requires specific preservation efforts suggests that there may be limitations on their liability. This means the \u2018A&K\u2019 are likely not liable for the injury caused by the camera-related issues.**\n* **Potential for Negligence Claim**: If the contract doesn't include an exclusion clause, A&K could potentially be held liable for the damage to Due South's property if they can prove that the company failed to exercise reasonable care in their work.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nBased on the information provided, it appears the \u2018A&B\u2019 have a potential claim against the company for breach of contract (if they were to be held liable for the inclusion of this information).\n\n\n**Important Note:** This analysis is based solely on the information given in the scenario.

If the husband is able to demonstrate that the photographer\u2019s actions were\n    negligent and led to financial losses for him (due to missing the photoshoot), it would be an important element of the claim.\n\n**Important Note**: This scenario presents a situation where Due To, the \u2018injured party\u2019, might have grounds for a lawsuit against Azlin's husband for the above reasons.\n\n\n**IR**\n"

            "This scenario presents a few interesting legal points related to the concept of negligence and its impact on Due South's liability for potential injuries. Here are some additional tort-related issues that might arise from this situation, along with relevant case law considerations:\n\n\n**4. Potential Tort Issues:**\n\n* **Negligence in the Construction Process**: While the camera incident occurred after the MCST had already been established, the fact that the renovations were done to a \u2018third party\u2019 standard (in this case, the 1940 standards) becomes relevant if it leads to an injury.\n* **Liability for Defective Premises**:\n\nThis is where the situation gets tricky. If the $2,500 cost of the repair was incurred due to the lack of proper warning and signage by Due South, leading to the damage caused by the \u2018defective\u2019 camera, they could be liable for this. \n* **Duty of Care**:\n\nThe case law surrounding duty of care in Singapore is complex but generally focuses on the concept of \"reasonable foreseeability\" and \"duty to warn.\" The fact that the camera was a third party (in this case, a photographer from the previous year) could be relevant if Due Azlin\u2019s claim for damages.\n\n**4a. Potential for Future Tort Claims**:\n\n* **Duty of Care**: If A&K were to sue for their losses due to the \u2018Sook Ching Massacre\u2019 incident, they would need to prove that the photographer was aware of the potential for this type of injury (i.e., the lack of proper safety measures) and did not take adequate steps to prevent it.\n\n* **Duty to Warn**: The camera company's liability is based on the concept of \"duty to warn\" - a duty they owe to anyone who might be injured by their product. If A&K had been aware of the potential for injury in the previous year, they would have been able to prove that the fountain was not properly constructed to handle the \u2018ex-boyfriend\u2019s\u2019 concerns.\n\n**5. Potential for Duty to Warn Issues**:\n\n* **Foreseeability**: The fact that the MCST is demanding compensation from both parties suggests that they are claiming that the injury to the \u2018fountain\u2019 (the wall) should have been reasonably foreseeable. This could be a valid argument if they were aware of the potential for accidents and had not taken adequate precautions to prevent them.\n\n* **Duty to Warn**: The couple could argue that Due South, as the company responsible for the construction of the house, owed them a duty to warn about the potential dangers of the \u2018Sook Ching\u2019 situation. This is because they are claiming that Due South\u2019s negligence in not properly securing the camera led to their injury.\n\n* **Causation**: The question of causation arises from the fact that the couple had access to the fountain and was aware of its condition. If the new construction standards were significantly lower than",
            "This scenario raises several interesting legal questions, particularly regarding the liability of A&K (the couple) and the potential for a claim against DI (the furniture company). Here's how we can analyze it through the lens of Tort Law:\n\n\n**4.  Potential Tort Issues for A&K:**\n\n* **Negligence**: The question of whether Due Due\u2019s actions or inaction constitutes negligence is a key issue here. \n    * **Rule**: Negligence occurs when there is a duty of care, a breach of that duty, causation between the breach and the injury, and damages.\n    * **Application**: In this case, the \u2018third party\u2019 in the scenario, the couple who are being sued by the third party for the wall and furniture to be repaired.\n\n**Potential Legal Issues:**\n\n* **Negligence (of Due's) - Level of Care**: The question arises: did Due South owe A&K a duty of care? While the scenario mentions that the 3-story building is built in a way that it was possible for A&K to be sued for a breach of this standard, it doesn\u2019t mention if they were aware of the potential for injury. If they were aware of the potential for \u2018holding area\u2019 and didn\u2019t take steps to prevent people from being injured by the wall (which is a common issue in Singapore).\n\n* **Causation**: The scenario states that A&K will be suing for the damage caused to their home, which is the key element of a successful claim. \n    * **Rule**: To prove negligence, it must be shown that Due\u2019s actions (or inaction) were directly responsible for the injury occurring.\n\n* **Breach of Contract**: If A&K had provided specific instructions to Due South regarding the safety concerns and the lack of \u2018exclusions\u2019 in their contract with the photographer's name,\n    * **Rule**: The company is liable for any damage caused by its actions that are directly related to the construction of the house.\n\n**Potential Legal Issues:**\n\n\n**For A&K**:\n\n* **Breach of Contract**: If A&K were aware of the potential for a \u2018phantom\u2019 to be injured due to their lack of safety precautions in their design and renovation plans, they may have a claim against A&K for negligence.\n    * **Rule**: If the couple had concerns about the safety of the structure of the building (which is a third party issue)\n\n**For the Photographer:**\n\n\n**Breach of Contract**:\n\nThis scenario raises several questions about the nature of the \u2018fountain\u2019 and the type of exclusion clause that would be needed to protect against this specific situation. \n    * **Rule**: If A&K had not taken any precautions to prevent injury, then the photographer is responsible for their own injuries.\n\n\n**Other Potential Issues:**\n\n* **Breach of Duty**: A&",
