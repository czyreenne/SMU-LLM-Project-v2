    "scenario": "Twenty-eight year old Marcela is a streamer who has built a sizeable fan base (of around\n500,000 subscribers) on the augmented reality (AR) streaming platform \u201cWitch\u201d. The\nplatform was founded 6 years ago and is based in Singapore. Its main selling point is a\nrange of AR \ufb01lters called \u2014 \u201cperspectives\u201d or \u201cpaxes\u201d by the community \u2014 which let\nstreamers superimpose hyper-realistic 3D graphics over real world video. These can be\nactivated at the click of a button, and streamers generally do not concern themselves with\nhow they work.\nThe platform rose to fame because of its dedication towards helping its creators make con-\ntent (and money) \u201clike magic\u201d. Since the beginning, Witch maintained a \u201ccreator \ufb01rst\u201d\npolicy which very publicly declares that all subscription fees \u201cgo directly in the \ufb01rst in-\nstance to our content creators; we only take a modest amount to keep the platform run-\nning\u201d. This modest amount is 10% of the subscription fee viewers pay. Creators alone\ndecide how much to set these fees at. In this regard, Witch differs from usual platforms\nwhere, in those other platforms, (1) viewer money goes \ufb01rst to the platform which takes\na cut before disbursing funds to the streamer\u2019s account, (2) average platform fees range\nbetween 20\u201330%; and (3) creators are required to charge an amount the platform sets.\nThe relationship between Witch and its creators is shaped by Witch\u2019s Terms of Use which\nbinds both creators and viewers alike. The Terms state that Witch is \u201cnot responsible for\nany content our creators publish on our platform\u201d. Nothing else in the Terms is material.\nAs for Marcela, her success really began in October last year, when she decided to do\na Halloween special. She streamed herself taking a walk through Bishan-Ang Mo Kio\npark at night while using one of Witch\u2019s \u201chorror\u201d paxes to make it seem as if every other\nhuman in the park was some kind of nightly horror \u2014 zombies, werewolves, giants, beasts,\nvampires, and ghosts galore. That stream attracted 50,000 active viewers.\nBut all that was last year. Since then, Marcela has organised her channel around horror\nstreams: night visits to the abandoned Old Changi Hospital, mysterious spots in Pulau\nUbin, etc, all of them enhanced by Witch\u2019s paxes. This has won her dedicated subscriber\nbase amongst Singapore teens aged 14\u201320, who enjoy watching her streams with friends\nat sleepovers and the like.\n AY2022/23-I\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n3\nCapitalising on her success, on 12 August 2022 Marcela planned a huge \u201cSeventh Month\nSpecial\u201d. This coincided with the \ufb01rst day of the Lunar seventh month, a date broadly\nunderstood in Chinese superstition as the day the gates of the Underworld open, allowing\nits denizens to roam the world of the living. Marcela asked Witch if they could make her\na \u201cspecial, extra scary Seventh Month pax which shows extremely realistic ghosts \ufb02ying\neverywhere, so that my subscribers get the fright of their lives\u201d. Witch readily agreed, as it\nwas raring to try out a new AR generation software its engineers had just \ufb01nished building.\nMarcela marketed the event aggressively on her channel, asking her viewers to \u201cinvite all\nyour friends and non-believers to come and witness the true meaning of horror (at your\nown risk!)\u201d.\nMarcela then set herself up on 11 August 2022, 2300 hours, in the middle of Lim Chu\nKang cemetery. Together with her viewers, she counted down to midnight. By 2355\nhours, her stream had upwards of 250,000 viewers (not including those watching through\ntheir friends\u2019 accounts). Once the clock struck twelve, Marcela turned the new pax on.\nWhat transpired was truly the meaning of horror. It turned out that Witch\u2019s engineers had\nbuilt the new software by training a machine learning algorithm on particularly gruesome\nand grisly images \u2014 the sort that would be banned outright from television. This included\nreal images of dead, dismembered, and decaying humans and other (previously) living\nthings. That was how they were able to replicate hyper-realistic, and utterly frightful AR\nvisions. Witch did not realise that paxes created by this software had the potential to repro-\nduce the exact same images on their platform (in hyper-realistic 3D no less). Because of a\ncareless oversight on Witch\u2019s part, the new software did not go through quality assurance\nor censorship before deployment.\nThe moment the \ufb01lter was enabled, gory images in the software\u2019s training data were in-\nstantly broadcast to all of Marcela\u2019s viewers, in\ufb02icting severe distress and emotional dam-\nage. As she was busy \ufb01lming, Marcela did not realise what was happening until a sharp\nfall in viewer count minutes into the stream prompted her to check what they were seeing.\nShe immediately turned the \ufb01lter off when she did.\nBy then, however, the damage had been done. Marcela went from expecting 10,000 new\nsubscribers from that event to losing 250,000 subscribers overnight.\nThis causes her\nmonthly subscriber revenue to plunge by $250,000, as she charges $1/month. She also\n \nAnswer all the following questions using only material covered up till and not includ-\ning the Standard of Care. You also need not discuss anything to do with defences.\n1.

These, she estimates,\nwould have net her another 25,000 new subscribers. To make things worse, two months\nlater she gets a lawyer\u2019s letter from Khan, who had developed a recognised psychiatric\ninjury from watching her stream. Though she is completely \ufb01ne herself, Marcela suspects\nthat many other viewers could have come down with such psychiatric injuries as well.\n* * *\nAnswer all the following questions using only material covered up till and not includ-\ning the Standard of Care.

            "1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\nMy answer is:\n**Issue**: Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a duty of care arises when there is a relationship between the parties, and the defendant's actions or omissions cause or have the potential to cause harm to the plaintiff. The relationship must be close enough to give rise to a duty of care.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Marcela is a streamer on Witch's platform. Witch provides Marcela with the platform and tools to create content, and Marcela uses these to build her fan base. Witch also has a \"creator first\" policy, which means that it takes a modest amount of the subscription fees and gives the rest to the creators. This relationship is close enough to give rise to a duty of care.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, Witch owes Marcela a duty of care.\n\nPlease provide your feedback and guidance on the answer. I would appreciate any suggestions for improvement. Thank you!  AY2022/23-I\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n5\n```\n\n\n\n## Feedback and Guidance\n\nOverall, your answer is well-structured and provides a clear analysis of the legal issue.

            "1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\nMy answer is:\n**Issue**: Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a duty of care arises when there is a sufficient relationship between the parties, such as a contractual relationship, a pre-existing relationship, or a special relationship (Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562).\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Witch and Marcela have a contractual relationship through the Terms of Use, which binds both creators and viewers alike. The relationship between Witch and Marcela is shaped by the contractual agreement, where Witch provides the platform and Marcela creates content for the platform. This contractual relationship creates a sufficient relationship between the parties, giving rise to a duty of care.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, Witch owes Marcela a duty of care.\n\nPlease provide feedback on my answer and suggest any improvements. I look forward to your response. Thank you!",
            "1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\nMy answer is:\n**Issue**: Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a duty of care arises when there is a sufficient relationship between the parties, such as a contractual relationship, a fiduciary relationship, or a special relationship that gives rise to a duty to take reasonable care. [1]\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Witch and Marcela have a contractual relationship through the Terms of Use, which binds both creators and viewers alike. Witch is a platform that provides a service to its creators, including Marcela, by allowing them to publish content on the platform. Marcela relies on Witch to provide a safe and suitable environment for her content, including the AR filters. Therefore, a sufficient relationship exists between Witch and Marcela, giving rise to a duty of care.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, Witch owes Marcela a duty of care.\n\nPlease provide your feedback on my answer. I would appreciate any suggestions or corrections you may have.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Law Firm]\n[Contact Information]\n AY2022/23-I\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n5\nReferences:\n[1] Chan v.

            "2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n\nMy answer is:\n**Issue**: Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a duty of care arises when there is a sufficient nexus between the parties and the harm caused.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Khan is a viewer who suffered psychiatric injury after watching Marcela's stream. There is a sufficient nexus between Marcela's stream and the harm caused to Khan, as Marcela's stream was the direct cause of Khan's injury. Therefore, Marcela owes Khan a duty of care.\n\nHowever, the situation is more complex when it comes to Witch. Witch is the platform provider, and its role is to provide a platform for streamers like Marcela to broadcast their content. While Witch did provide the AR software that was used in Marcela's stream, it did not directly cause the harm to Khan. Therefore, it is unclear whether Witch owes Khan a duty of care.\n\n**Conclusion**: Marcela owes Khan a duty of care, but it is uncertain whether Witch owes Khan a duty of care.\n\nPlease provide feedback on my answer. Thank you. \n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is Marcela owes Khan a duty of care, but it is uncertain whether Witch owes Khan a duty of care. I hope it is correct.

            "2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n\nMy answer is:\n**Issue**: Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n\n**Rule**: In Singapore, a duty of care arises when there is a sufficient relationship between the parties, such as a contractual relationship, a special relationship, or a relationship of proximity.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Witch and Marcela have a contractual relationship with Khan as a subscriber to their platform. Khan has a recognized psychiatric injury from watching Marcela's stream. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Witch or Marcela had any knowledge or foresight of the potential harm that their actions could cause to Khan. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that Witch or Marcela had any direct interaction with Khan or that they owed him a special duty of care.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, based on the facts provided, it appears that neither Witch nor Marcela owe Khan a duty of care.\n\nPlease provide feedback on the answer, including any suggestions for improvement. \n\nI am grateful for your time and feedback.

Other than negligence, are there any other tort(s) which Khan may use to sue Witch\nand/or Marcela?\n\nMy answer is:\n**Issue**: Are there any other torts, aside from negligence, that Khan may use to sue Witch and/or Marcela?\n\n**Rule**: In Singapore, tort law recognizes various causes of action beyond negligence, including...\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Khan may have a claim under the tort of...\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, Khan may use the tort of... to sue Witch and/or Marcela.\n\nPlease provide guidance on how to proceed with the answer.\n\nPlease note that I am not familiar with the specific case law and statutes related to this scenario.
