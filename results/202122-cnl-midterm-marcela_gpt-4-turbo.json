    "scenario": "Twenty-eight year old Marcela is a streamer who has built a sizeable fan base (of around\n500,000 subscribers) on the augmented reality (AR) streaming platform \u201cWitch\u201d. The\nplatform was founded 6 years ago and is based in Singapore. Its main selling point is a\nrange of AR \ufb01lters called \u2014 \u201cperspectives\u201d or \u201cpaxes\u201d by the community \u2014 which let\nstreamers superimpose hyper-realistic 3D graphics over real world video. These can be\nactivated at the click of a button, and streamers generally do not concern themselves with\nhow they work.\nThe platform rose to fame because of its dedication towards helping its creators make con-\ntent (and money) \u201clike magic\u201d. Since the beginning, Witch maintained a \u201ccreator \ufb01rst\u201d\npolicy which very publicly declares that all subscription fees \u201cgo directly in the \ufb01rst in-\nstance to our content creators; we only take a modest amount to keep the platform run-\nning\u201d. This modest amount is 10% of the subscription fee viewers pay. Creators alone\ndecide how much to set these fees at. In this regard, Witch differs from usual platforms\nwhere, in those other platforms, (1) viewer money goes \ufb01rst to the platform which takes\na cut before disbursing funds to the streamer\u2019s account, (2) average platform fees range\nbetween 20\u201330%; and (3) creators are required to charge an amount the platform sets.\nThe relationship between Witch and its creators is shaped by Witch\u2019s Terms of Use which\nbinds both creators and viewers alike. The Terms state that Witch is \u201cnot responsible for\nany content our creators publish on our platform\u201d. Nothing else in the Terms is material.\nAs for Marcela, her success really began in October last year, when she decided to do\na Halloween special. She streamed herself taking a walk through Bishan-Ang Mo Kio\npark at night while using one of Witch\u2019s \u201chorror\u201d paxes to make it seem as if every other\nhuman in the park was some kind of nightly horror \u2014 zombies, werewolves, giants, beasts,\nvampires, and ghosts galore. That stream attracted 50,000 active viewers.\nBut all that was last year. Since then, Marcela has organised her channel around horror\nstreams: night visits to the abandoned Old Changi Hospital, mysterious spots in Pulau\nUbin, etc, all of them enhanced by Witch\u2019s paxes. This has won her dedicated subscriber\nbase amongst Singapore teens aged 14\u201320, who enjoy watching her streams with friends\nat sleepovers and the like.\n AY2022/23-I\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n3\nCapitalising on her success, on 12 August 2022 Marcela planned a huge \u201cSeventh Month\nSpecial\u201d. This coincided with the \ufb01rst day of the Lunar seventh month, a date broadly\nunderstood in Chinese superstition as the day the gates of the Underworld open, allowing\nits denizens to roam the world of the living. Marcela asked Witch if they could make her\na \u201cspecial, extra scary Seventh Month pax which shows extremely realistic ghosts \ufb02ying\neverywhere, so that my subscribers get the fright of their lives\u201d. Witch readily agreed, as it\nwas raring to try out a new AR generation software its engineers had just \ufb01nished building.\nMarcela marketed the event aggressively on her channel, asking her viewers to \u201cinvite all\nyour friends and non-believers to come and witness the true meaning of horror (at your\nown risk!)\u201d.\nMarcela then set herself up on 11 August 2022, 2300 hours, in the middle of Lim Chu\nKang cemetery. Together with her viewers, she counted down to midnight. By 2355\nhours, her stream had upwards of 250,000 viewers (not including those watching through\ntheir friends\u2019 accounts). Once the clock struck twelve, Marcela turned the new pax on.\nWhat transpired was truly the meaning of horror. It turned out that Witch\u2019s engineers had\nbuilt the new software by training a machine learning algorithm on particularly gruesome\nand grisly images \u2014 the sort that would be banned outright from television. This included\nreal images of dead, dismembered, and decaying humans and other (previously) living\nthings. That was how they were able to replicate hyper-realistic, and utterly frightful AR\nvisions. Witch did not realise that paxes created by this software had the potential to repro-\nduce the exact same images on their platform (in hyper-realistic 3D no less). Because of a\ncareless oversight on Witch\u2019s part, the new software did not go through quality assurance\nor censorship before deployment.\nThe moment the \ufb01lter was enabled, gory images in the software\u2019s training data were in-\nstantly broadcast to all of Marcela\u2019s viewers, in\ufb02icting severe distress and emotional dam-\nage. As she was busy \ufb01lming, Marcela did not realise what was happening until a sharp\nfall in viewer count minutes into the stream prompted her to check what they were seeing.\nShe immediately turned the \ufb01lter off when she did.\nBy then, however, the damage had been done. Marcela went from expecting 10,000 new\nsubscribers from that event to losing 250,000 subscribers overnight.\nThis causes her\nmonthly subscriber revenue to plunge by $250,000, as she charges $1/month. She also\n \nAnswer all the following questions using only material covered up till and not includ-\ning the Standard of Care. You also need not discuss anything to do with defences.\n1.

These, she estimates,\nwould have net her another 25,000 new subscribers. To make things worse, two months\nlater she gets a lawyer\u2019s letter from Khan, who had developed a recognised psychiatric\ninjury from watching her stream. Though she is completely \ufb01ne herself, Marcela suspects\nthat many other viewers could have come down with such psychiatric injuries as well.\n* * *\nAnswer all the following questions using only material covered up till and not includ-\ning the Standard of Care.

        "question_1": [
            "Yes, Witch likely owes Marcela a duty of care. In determining whether a duty of care exists, common law principles generally consider whether the harm was reasonably foreseeable, whether there was sufficient proximity between the parties, and whether it is fair, just, and reasonable to impose a duty of care. \n\nIn Marcela\u2019s case, the relationship between Witch and Marcela as a content creator and platform provider implies a significant degree of proximity. Marcela relies on Witch's technology and platform to broadcast her content and earn revenue, while Witch benefits commercially from hosting popular content creators like Marcela, thereby attracting more users and generating more income.\n\nThe harm to Marcela was reasonably foreseeable. Witch provides the technology (paxes) that Marcela uses directly in her streams; thus, it should be foreseeable that any significant malfunctions or issues with this technology could harm Marcela's professional standing and financial stability. Specifically, Witch agreed to create a \"special, extra scary\" pax for Marcela, knowing the intended use and the importance of the event. This bespoke development increases the foreseeability of potential issues, as it involves crafting new and untested software.\n\nFinally, it is fair, just, and reasonable to impose a duty of care on Witch. The platform is in control of the technological tools it provides and is better positioned to manage the risks associated with these tools, such as ensuring the appropriate testing and quality assurance of the paxes before they are released for use by streamers. Considering Witch's role in approving and providing these technologies, along with the direct financial implications for creators based on the platform's performance, imposing a duty of care aligns with legal principles protecting individuals and entities from foreseeable harm resulting from another's negligence.\n\nTherefore, given the reasonable foreseeability of harm, the proximity of the relationship, and the appropriateness of imposing a legal obligation, Witch does owe Marcela a duty of care.",
            "To determine whether Witch owes Marcela a duty of care, we first need to establish the fundamental principles upon which duty of care is founded in the tort of negligence. Generally, a duty of accountability is established if three key elements are met:\n\n1. **Foreseeability**: Whether it was foreseeable that Marcela could suffer harm as a consequence of Witch\u2019s actions or inactions.\n2. **Proximity**: Whether there was a close relationship between Witch and Marcela that would justify imposition of a duty.\n3. **Reasonableness**: Whether it is reasonable to impose a duty under the circumstances.\n\n### Analysis\n\n**Foreseeability**: In the relationship between Witch and Marcela, it was foreseeable that any failure on the part of Witch to ensure the proper functioning and safety of its AR filters could lead to legal, financial, and reputational harm to Marcela. The use of AR technology to generate realistic and potentially distressing scenarios underscores its possible impact on viewers. Thus, any error in the implementation or content depicted by these filters could foretell harmful repercussions for the creator utilizing them\u2014in this case, Marcela.\n\n**Proximity**: Marcela and Witch share a direct service-provider and client relationship. Marcela relies on Witch\u2019s technology and infrastructure to conduct her streaming activities and generate income. Moreover, the specific nature of their engagement where Witch agreed to develop a \"special, extra scary\" filter at Marcela\u2019s request significantly enhances the proximity. Witch tailored this service specifically for Marcela\u2019s stream, implying a closer than usual relationship in this instance.\n\n**Reasonableness**: It would be reasonable to posit that Witch owes a duty of care to its content creators, like Marcela, especially when they develop bespoke solutions at the creators' requests. This duty extends to ensuring that such capabilities do not cause foreseeable harm, such as emotional distress to the audience and reputational damage to the streamer. Additionally, reasonable care includes proper testing and assurance of new technology before its deployment, particularly when the content might be extremely sensitive or distressing.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the foreseeability of harm, the close and direct relationship between Witch and Marcela, and the reasonableness of expecting Witch to exercise care in the provision and deployment of its services, it is likely that Witch owes a duty of care to Marcela. This duty was particularly pertinent in ensuring that the newly developed AR filter did not contain excessively disturbing content and was appropriate and safe for public dissemination. Failure to fulfill these obligations could be seen as a breach of this duty, subject to other factors and analysis beyond the \"standard of care\".\n",
            "Yes, Witch does owe Marcela a duty of care. To establish whether a duty of care exists, we need to consider three elements: foreseeability, proximity, and whether it is fair, just, and reasonable to impose a duty.\n\n1. **Foreseeability**: It was foreseeable that the content created through Witch\u2019s paxes, if not appropriately screened or curated, could cause significant distress or harm to viewers. As it was Witch who developed and provided the \"special, extra scary Seventh Month pax\" at Marcela's request, it was reasonable to foresee that any technical or content issues with this pax could impact Marcela directly, affecting her subscriber count and revenue.\n\n2. **Proximity**: Marcela and Witch share a proximate relationship where Marcela relies on Witch's platform and technology for conducting her business. Marcela's request for a custom pax and Witch\u2019s agreement to provide one specifically tailored for her event deepens this proximity. Witch, knowing the direct impact of their service on Marcela\u2019s professional streaming career, holds a responsibility to ensure the tools they provide meet a certain standard of quality and safety.\n\n3. **Fair, just, and reasonable**: Given the nature of the relationship between an AR platform and its content creators, it is fair, just, and reasonable to impose a duty of care on Witch. Witch benefits commercially from the content creators and hence, should ensure that the tools (paxes) they provide do not adversely affect the creators' interests. Moreover, Witch's actions of developing and deploying new paxes without rigorous quality checks can be seen as neglecting the reasonable care owed to Marcela, whom they directly engaged with to create a new AR experience.\n\nTherefore, based on these criteria, there is a strong argument that Witch owes a duty of care to Marcela, particularly to ensure that any content or technology provided does not cause harm to her business or reputation."

        "question_2": [
            "To assess whether Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care, it is essential to apply the principles of the law of negligence. The law generally imposes a duty of care when certain conditions are met, primarily involving a reasonable foreseeability of harm resulting from one's actions, a relationship of proximity between the parties, and it must be fair, just, and reasonable to impose a duty.\n\n### Analysis for Witch:\n\n1. **Foreseeability of Harm**: It is reasonably foreseeable that broadcasting extremely graphic and horrifying content could cause psychological or emotional distress to viewers. The nature of Marcela's Halloween special, meant to give a fright and utilizing hyper-realistic AR, increases the likelihood that such harm could occur.\n\n2. **Proximity**: Witch, as the provider of the platform and the specific AR software used by Marcela, is in proximity to the viewers, including Khan. Witch directly impacts the viewer experience through the provision of its technology. \n\n3. **Fair, Just, and Reasonable**: Given the control Witch has over the content distributed through its AR filters and software, it is justifiable to argue that the platform should bear responsibility for the content it facilitates, especially when it provides specialized, powerful tools capable of significant psychological impact. \n\nConsidering these factors, Witch likely owes a duty of care to Khan and other viewers to ensure that the content broadcast through its platform does not cause undue harm.\n\n### Analysis for Marcelaa:\n\n1. **Foreseeability of Harm**: Marcela, being an experienced content creator specializing in horror-themed content, should reasonably foresee the potential for causing distress with particularly intense or realistic horror content. However, the specific nature of the content produced by the new AR software was unknown to her before the broadcast.\n\n2. **Proximity**: Marcela does have a direct relationship with her viewers, including Khan. Her actions directly affect her audience, and she interacts with them through her streams.\n\n3. **Fair, Just, and Reasonable**: It may be considered reasonable for Marcela to ensure the content she streams is not excessively harmful. However, her lack of knowledge about the specific nature of the images displayed (due to Witch's failure in quality assurance) complicates the imposition of duty solely on her. \n\nMarcela potentially owes a duty of care, but her liability may be mitigated by her reliance on Witch to provide safe and appropriate AR content. \n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth Witch and Marcela likely owe a duty of care to Khan, but the extent and nature of that duty, particularly for Marcela, might be influenced by her reasonable expectation that the AR content provided by Witch was suitable for broadcast. Witch\u2019s role is more clearly defined due to their control over the content creation tools and their failure to conduct adequate checks before deployment.",
            "To determine whether Witch or Marcela owes Kahn a duty of care, it is important to consider the principles that are typically used to establish such a duty under the tort of negligence in common law jurisdictions. A duty of care generally involves three key criteria: foreseeability of harm, relationship of proximity or closeness, and that it is fair, just, and reasonable to impose a duty.\n\n**Application to Witch:**\n\n1. **Foreseeability:** It was reasonably foreseeable that broadcasting hyper-realistic, gory, and disturbing images could cause distress or psychiatric harm. Witch, having developed a new AR generation software, should have foreseen the potential harm that could result from its use without proper quality assurance and supervision. The announcement of a \u201cspecial, extra scary\u201d AR effect could have prepared Witch for the impact this might have on sensitive viewers.\n\n2. **Proximity:** Witch provided the specific AR filter used by Marcela, directly influencing the content broadcast to her viewers, including Khan. The proximity is established through the direct provision and enabling of content that caused the injury.\n\n3. **Fairness, justness, and reasonability:** Holding Witch accountable by imposing a duty of care aligns with public expectations that companies managing and providing technology that can significantly affect public exposure should take reasonable measures to prevent harm. This includes proper testing and content moderation practices.\n\nGiven these considerations, Witch likely owes a duty of care to Khan, as their actions and inactions directly facilitated the broadcasting of harmful content.\n\n**Application to Marcela:**\n\n1. **Foreseeability:** Marcela, although responsible for the content she broadcasts, primarily depended on the technology provided by Witch and might not have technical expertise to foresee the specific output of the AR effects. While she aimed to create a scary experience, the extent to which this could translate into real psychological distress using the newly developed AR software may not have been fully predictable to her.\n\n2. **Proximity:** Marcela does have a direct relationship with her viewers, as she creates and broadcasts content with the intention of being viewed and interacted with. However, the critical content causing the harm\u2014the graphic nature of the AR images\u2014was produced by Witch, not Marcela.\n\n3. **Fairness, justness, and reasonability:** While Marcela has a responsibility towards her viewers, it could be argued that it is not reasonable to expect a content creator to fully anticipate or understand the intricate technical outputs of sophisticated, third-party AR technology. The real-time nature of streaming also limits her ability to control live content fully.\n\nConclusively, while Marcela does have some duty towards her viewers concerning the content she decides to broadcast, the specific circumstances here \u2014 her reliance on Witch\u2019s technology and the unexpected outcome of the new software \u2014 may temper the extent of her duty in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, Witch likely owes a duty of care to Khan, due to their control over the AR content and its impacts. Marcela\u2019s duty of care is less clear and could arguably be limited by her dependency on Witch\u2019s technology and the unforeseen nature of the technological output.",
            "To determine whether either Witch or Marcela owes Khan a duty of care, a three-step test is generally applied: foreseeability, proximity, and whether it is fair, just, and reasonable to impose a duty.\n\n### Foreseeability:\n- **Witch**: It could be argued that it was foreseeable that deploying an untested AR filter, especially one designed to enhance the horror element for a live stream, could cause distress or harm to viewers. Given that the software was trained on particularly gruesome and grisly images, the potential for causing emotional or psychological harm should have been foreseeable.\n- **Marcela**: As the host and broadcaster, Marcela could foresee that using a highly realistic and intense horror-themed AR filter could affect her viewers. However, her anticipation of the filter effects would rely heavily on the information and assurances given by Witch regarding its operation and content.\n\n### Proximity:\n- **Witch**: There is a direct relational proximity to the viewers, including Khan, as the provider of the platform and the new AR filter used during the stream. This proximity places viewers in a position where they are directly impacted by the content and functionality of the filter provided by Witch.\n- **Marcela**: There is also proximity between Marcela and her viewers, including Khan. Viewers tuned into her stream with the expectation of entertainment based on the content she curates and presents, which in this case included the use of Witch's new AR filter.\n\n### Fair, just, and reasonable to impose duty:\n- **Witch**: It would be reasonable to impose a duty of care on Witch, given that they are a commercial entity profiting from the content and tools they provide to streamers and viewers. As they directly control the content and tools' quality and safety, there is a societal expectation for them to ensure that these do not cause harm.\n- **Marcela**: Imposing a duty of care on Marcela might be seen as reasonable to ensure that she does not recklessly use tools that could harm her viewers. However, her ability to control or know the detailed functioning of the AR filters (especially newly created ones) is limited compared to Witch.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth Witch and Marcela likely owe Khan a duty of care, albeit their responsibilities differ in scope based on their control and knowledge over the content delivered during the stream. Witch has a higher duty to verify and ensure the safety and appropriateness of their AR filters, while Marcela has a duty to responsibly use the tools provided and ensure to the best of her knowledge that content shared is not likely to cause substantial harm to her viewers. Thus, both could potentially be found negligent if these duties were found to have been breached."

        "question_3": [
            "Question 3 - Other potentially applicable torts:\n\nBeyond negligence, Khan may consider the following torts against Witch and/or Marcela:\n\n1. **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)**:\n   This tort requires proof that the defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly, and that this conduct caused severe emotional distress. Given the nature of the content, if it could be argued that Witch and/or Marcela were reckless about the potential impact of the hyper-realistic, gory images (especially given the significance of the day and setting), this could potentially fit the criteria for IIED. Khan would need to demonstrate that Witch and Marcela\u2019s conduct was so extreme as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency.\n\n2. **Nuisance**:\n   Nuisance involves an interference with the right to use and enjoy property. Khan might argue that the traumatic images streamed into his private space (e.g., home) substantially and unreasonably interfered with his enjoyment of his property. This might be more of a stretch as nuisance typically deals with physical invasions or obstructions, but the intrusive nature of the content and its profound impact could form the basis for such a claim.\n\n3. **Breach of Contractual Duty**:\n   If Khan was a subscriber to Marcela\u2019s stream under conditions stipulated by a contract (including subscription terms which may warrant content of a certain nature), he could argue breach of contract if the content delivered was not as described or was beyond reasonable expectations of content flagged as \u2018horror\u2019. This would pivot on the specifics of any subscriber agreement he accepted.\n\n4. **Misrepresentation**:\n   If Marcela or Witch made specific representations about the nature of the content that were false \u2013 and which Khan relied upon to his detriment \u2013 there may be a case for misrepresentation. However, this would depend significantly on the specific marketing and descriptions provided by Marcela and Witch before the stream. \n\nTo better analyze Khan's possible actions, further details about the warnings provided before the stream, the exact nature of marketing from Marcela, and any communications or disclaimers from Witch would be necessary. Khan must show reliance on any misrepresentations to claim damages successfully under this tort.\n\nIn conclusion, while negligence may be the primary avenue for a lawsuit in this situation, these additional torts might provide alternative grounds depending on the specific facts and evidence surrounding the case and the applicable laws in the jurisdiction in which Khan decides to file the suit.",
            "**Sub-question 3: Other than negligence, are there any other torts which Khan may use to sue Witch and/or Marcela?**\n\nKhan, who has developed a recognized psychiatric injury from watching Marcela's AR-enhanced stream, might consider the following torts in addition to negligence:\n\n1. **Intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED)** - Also referred to as the tort of outrage, this occurs when one party intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to another through their extreme and outrageous conduct. In this case, Khan could argue that the content broadcast by Marcela, especially due to its explicit and unexpected nature, was extreme and outrageous, intended to cause severe emotional distress. However, establishing this tort would depend on whether Witch or Marcela's actions can be seen as intentional or reckless. Given that Marcela was unaware of the specific content of the \"special, extra scary Seventh Month pax\" due to Witch\u2019s lack of quality assurance and oversight, it might be challenging to prove that she acted with intent or recklessness.\n\n2. **Negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED)** - This tort allows a plaintiff to recover for emotional distress caused by the defendant\u2019s negligent conduct rather than intentional or reckless conduct. It would require demonstrating that Witch or Marcela owed a duty of care to Khan, breached this duty through negligence, and caused his psychiatric injury as a result. Since Witch failed to review the new software adequately, resulting in the transmission of distressing content, they could potentially be liable for NIED. Marcela's liability might hinge on whether a reasonable streamer in her position ought to have foreseen the risk of such harm from the implementation of an untested pax.\n\n3. **Breach of statutory duty** - Although not a traditional common law tort, if local regulations in Singapore specifically govern digital content and its impact on viewers, non-compliance by Witch or Marcela could constitute a breach of statutory duty. This angle would require exploring relevant Singaporean media or broadcast laws to see if they apply to online streaming content and whether such laws were violated in the broadcasting of distressing content.\n\n4. **Trespass to the person (if applicable)** - Traditionally encompassing battery, assault, and false imprisonment, trespass to the person may be a stretch in this context. However, in certain legal theories, if the virtual intrusion of horrifying images could be argued to represent a form of assault (causing apprehension of immediate harm), there might be a novel application here. Yet, this would be highly unconventional and would heavily depend on the specifics of local law interpretations.\n\nIn summary, while negligence might be the most straightforward approach for Khan, exploring the potential for IIED or NIED could provide alternate avenues for legal recourse. Any statutory violations related to broadcasting standards could also bolster his case. Given the innovative technology and unique circumstances presented by AR content delivery, this scenario could also prompt legal interpretations that extend or adapt existing torts to new digital contexts.",
            "Yes, apart from negligence, Khan may consider pursuing tort claims against Witch and/or Marcelate under the following torts:\n\n1. **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)**: Khan could argue that Witch and Marcela engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct that intentionally or recklessly caused severe emotional distress. The use of extremely gruesome images, which could potentially be seen as beyond the bounds of decency, especially given the context of a public livestream, might fulfill the \"outrageousness\" criterion necessary for this tort. However, the success of this argument could hinge on proving intent or recklessness, which might be more directly applicable to Witch considering they developed and failed to properly test the software. Marcela, on the other hand, might not have known the specific content of the pax beforehand, which could impact her liability under this claim.\n\n2. **Infliction of Mental Suffering**: This is closely related to IIED but focuses on cases where the defendant's conduct was negligent rather than intentional or reckless. If it can be established that Witch had a duty to prevent harm and breached this duty through poor quality control thus causing Khan's psychiatric injury, this tort might be applicable. It could also apply to Marcela if she had a duty to ensure her content was not unduly harmful and breached this duty by not reviewing the content beforehand or reacting too slowly to stop the stream.\n\n3. **Breach of Duty of Care Resulting in Psychiatric Injury**: This would again center on the premise that both Witch and Marcela had a duty to avoid causing psychiatric harm. Witch's failure in its duty to adequately vet and test the AR filter before its use might be a direct cause of Khan's injuries. For Marcela, the question would revolve around her role in using the technology and her responsibilities toward her viewers.\n\nIn arguing these torts, the key factors that would determine the applicability and likelihood of success include Witch\u2019s and Marcela's awareness and foresight of the harm, the directness of their actions to the harm caused, and the expectation of the viewers\u2019 reaction to typical content versus what was actually shown during the Seventh Month Special stream. Further, since specifics on Marcela's knowledge of the content are unclear, attributing responsibility to her might require more factual details about what she knew regarding the pax details and the precautions (if any) she took before using them in her stream. The extent of testing and quality checks (or the lack thereof) performed by Witch before releasing the new pax will also be crucial.\n\nThese considerations would ultimately impact the viability of these alternative tort claims beyond simple negligence."
