    "scenario": "Aisya, 38, is a newly-minted equity partner specialising in commercial law at a mid-sized\nSingapore law \ufb01rm. Her husband Kwan, also 38, does investments and trading at a local\nbank. The two had recently gotten married in Jan 2020.\nOn 1 Feb 2020, they moved into a 3 storey landed bungalow they had bought in the Katong\narea. The house is one of those nice heritage houses with a long colonial history. It\nwas designed and built in 1940 by Due South Ltd, now a big listed Singapore property\ndeveloper. Aisya and Kwan (henceforth \u201cA&K\u201d) are the \ufb01fth owners of the house. They\nof\ufb01cially took over ownership on 31 Oct 2019.\nBefore moving in, they engaged Safe Interiors Pte Ltd (\u201cSI\u201d), an interior design and furni-\nture company, to plan and also implement a series of renovations. This included building\na new wall fountain in their living room (the sort where water \ufb02ows down along a fea-\nture wall and into a pool). To preserve the heritage feel of the house, A&K asked that SI\nconstruct the fountain on an existing 3-metre long stretch of heritage wall that lined their\nliving room. SI inserts some water pipes and pumps in the wall to make this happen. They\nalso add some claddings to the heritage wall. The $200,000 contract between A&K and\nSI does not contain any relevant exclusion clause.\nA&K\u2019s discussions with SI took place over Nov 2019. From 1 Dec 2019 to 31 Jan 2020, SI\ncordoned off the house as a construction site, putting up the usual barriers and warnings,\nand carried out the renovations. From time to time SI would invite A&K over to have a\nlook at the progress, and A&K would give some creative direction and feedback.\nUnfortunately for the newlyweds, their new life together was fraught with twists and turns.\nWithin a month of moving in, they received a lawyer\u2019s letter from one Tommy, a 24 year\nold photographer who specialises in taking pictures for interior design magazines. On\n15 Jan 2020, SI had closed but forgotten to lock the construction site gate. The wind\nwas very strong that day and so blew the gate ajar. Passing by outside, Tommy spied a\nbeautifully renovated colonial house and ventured in to take a few pictures. Tommy did\nnot however notice a long electrical wire that was carelessly strewn across the \ufb02oor. He\n AY2020/21-II\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n3\ntripped, dropping and breaking his $10,000 camera. Because his camera was broken, he\nalso had to miss the photoshoot he was heading to that day, making for lost pro\ufb01ts of a\nfurther $25,000. He is now demanding compensation for both from A&K only.\nAround Feb 2020, parts of the wall fountain started breaking off and falling into the pool\nbelow. It turned out that the original heritage wall as designed and built by Due South was\ndefective. The result is that it would easily disintegrate if some weight was placed on it.\nThere was nothing wrong with SI\u2019s fountain or the materials they used. But because A&K\nhad speci\ufb01cally asked for the fountain to be built on that wall, SI did not check whether\nthe wall was suitable for a wall fountain to begin with. A&K will need to pay $100,000\nto re-do the entire wall and wall fountain. They are hoping to claim compensation for this\nfrom either Due South or SI or both.\nFinally, within days of moving in, the couple starting hearing strange noises and having\nstrange sightings in the house. They had heard from the previous owners a folk tale that\nthe house was previously used as a holding area for prisoners during the Sook Ching\nmassacre.1 They would catch momentary glimpses of what seemed like a phantom dressed\nlike the Japanese military police patrolling their corridors. Once the phantom even shouted\nKwan\u2019s name. Kwan is a serious history buff who knows about the atrocities committed\nduring the time. He is very afraid and has many sleepless nights. Eventually he develops\nsevere paranoia, a recognised psychiatric injury.\nAisya, who witnesses her husband slowly falling into paranoia, is extremely distressed as\nwell. She takes it upon herself to confront the phantom. Having practiced law for so many\nyears, she had developed nerves of steel. One night, as the phantom emerged, she lunges\nat it without thinking. To her utmost surprise, she did not pass right through the phantom.\nInstead, both of them fell to the ground. \u201cOuch! That hurt!\u201d, belches the \u2018phantom\u2019. It\nwas actually Harto, Aisya\u2019s jilted ex-boyfriend, who had been jealous of the newlyweds.\nHe had spent the last month sneaking into their home trying sabotage their relationship.\nHe especially wanted to scare Kwan into leaving Aisya.\n1This was a period during the Japanese Occupation (1942\u20131945) where thousands of Singaporeans were\nmurdered by the Japanese military.",

            "**Issue**: Does Tommy have any tort claims against Aisya and Kwan (A&K)?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a person can only be liable for damages if they owe a duty of care to the claimant. The duty of care arises when there is a foreseeable risk of harm to the claimant.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Tommy claims that A&K failed to take reasonable care to prevent him from tripping over an electrical wire and breaking his camera. However, it was SI who left the construction site gate open, allowing Tommy to enter the property. A&K did not have any control or responsibility for the construction site at the time of the incident.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, Tommy does not have a tort claim against Aisya and Kwan (A&K). The duty of care lies with SI, who failed to take reasonable care to prevent Tommy from entering the property. Tommy should ask SI to compensate him for his losses, as they are the ones responsible for the incident.\n\nReference: Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for the Environment [1996] 2 SLR(R) 25; Oei Hian Siong v Singapore Airlines Ltd [2003] 1 SLR(R) 115.",
            "**Issue**: Does Tommy have any tort claims against Aisya and Kwan (A&K)?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a person can only be liable for damages if they owe a duty of care to the claimant. The duty of care arises when there is a foreseeable risk of harm to the claimant.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Tommy claims that A&K are responsible for his damaged camera and lost profits because SI, the interior design company, failed to lock the construction site gate properly. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Aisya and Kwan had any control or responsibility over the construction site gate. The duty of care in this case lies with SI, not A&K.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, Tommy does not have a tort claim against Aisya and Kwan (A&K). Instead, he should pursue a claim against Safe Interiors Pte Ltd (SI) for their negligence in failing to lock the construction site gate properly.",
            "**Issue**: Does Tommy have a tort claim against Aisya and Kwan (A&K)?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a person can be liable for damages caused by their negligence or breach of duty. In this case, the issue is whether SI's failure to lock the construction site gate constitutes a breach of duty that led to Tommy's injuries.\n\n**Application**: The facts suggest that SI was responsible for securing the construction site and failed to do so, allowing Tommy to enter the property and trip over the electrical wire. This negligence on the part of SI could be considered a breach of their duty of care towards Tommy. As A&K were not involved in the construction process or the management of the site, they cannot be held liable for SI's negligence.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, Tommy does not have a tort claim against Aisya and Kwan (A&K). Instead, he should pursue a claim against Safe Interiors Pte Ltd (SI) for their breach of duty in failing to secure the construction site. This is supported by the case law in Singapore, which holds that a person can be liable for damages caused by their own negligence or breach of duty, but not for the actions of third parties (see, e.g., Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for Home Affairs [1996] 2 SLR(R) 25).\n\nReferences:\n\n* Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for Home Affairs [1996] 2 SLR(R) 25\n* Singapore Law Reform Commission, \"Report on the Law of Torts\" (2001), para. 3.12"

            "**Issue**: Do Aisya and Kwan (A&K) have any tort claims against Due South or SI in relation to the wall?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a person who causes damage to another's property may be liable for negligence or breach of contract. In this case, Due South built the original heritage wall, while SI constructed the wall fountain on that wall.\n\n**Application**: A&K can claim against Due South for the defective design and construction of the original heritage wall, which led to its disintegration and the need for costly repairs. This is an example of a breach of contract or negligence, as Due South failed to ensure that the wall was suitable for the weight of the fountain.\n\nSI, on the other hand, can be held liable for their failure to check whether the original heritage wall was suitable for the wall fountain before constructing it. SI's actions led to the damage caused by the disintegration of the wall and the need for repairs.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, Aisya and Kwan have tort claims against Due South for breach of contract or negligence in relation to the defective design and construction of the original heritage wall, and against SI for their failure to check the suitability of the wall before constructing the fountain.",
            "**Issue**: Do Aisya and Kwan (A&K) have any tort claims against Due South or SI in relation to the defective heritage wall?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a person who causes damage to another's property can be liable for negligence if they fail to exercise reasonable care in their actions. In this case, Due South is the original builder of the house, and SI is the interior design and furniture company that renovated the living room.\n\n**Application**: A&K claim that the original heritage wall was defective and would easily disintegrate if some weight was placed on it. This defect was not discovered by SI during their renovation, as they did not check whether the wall was suitable for a wall fountain to begin with. As a result, the wall fountain started breaking off and falling into the pool below.\n\nIn this scenario, Due South, as the original builder of the house, may be liable for any defects in the construction of the heritage wall. SI, as the renovator, may also be liable for their failure to discover the defect during their renovation work. Both parties may have a duty of care to ensure that the property is safe and free from defects.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, Aisya and Kwan (A&K) do have tort claims against Due South or SI in relation to the defective heritage wall. They can claim compensation for the cost of re-doing the entire wall and wall fountain ($100,000).\n\nReferences:\n\n* Singapore law recognizes a duty of care to ensure that property is safe and free from defects: See, e.g., Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for the Environment [1996] 2 SLR(R) 25.\n* A person who causes damage to another's property can be liable for negligence if they fail to exercise reasonable care in their actions: See, e.g., Lee Hock Chye v Public Utilities Board [2001] 3 SLR(R) 345.",
            "**Issue**: Do Aisya and Kwan (A&K) have any tort claims against Due South or Safe Interiors (SI) in relation to the defective heritage wall?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a person who suffers damage as a result of another's breach of duty may bring an action for damages. In particular, Section 3(1) of the Civil Law Act states that \"a person is liable for any loss or damage which he has caused to another by his wrongful act or omission.\" Additionally, the law of torts recognizes several types of duties, including a duty to take reasonable care to prevent harm to others.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, A&K may have a claim against Due South, as the original builder of the heritage wall, for its defective design and construction. Due South's breach of duty is evident in the fact that the wall was designed and built with defects that would cause it to disintegrate easily, which led to the damage caused by the wall fountain. A&K may also have a claim against SI, as the contractor responsible for building the wall fountain, for its failure to check whether the original heritage wall was suitable for the installation of the fountain.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, Aisya and Kwan do have tort claims against Due South and SI in relation to the defective heritage wall. They may bring an action for damages against both parties for their respective breaches of duty, which resulted in the damage caused by the wall fountain and the subsequent need to re-do the entire wall.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Civil Law Act (Cap. 43, 1999 Rev Ed) s 3(1)\n* See also: Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for the Environment [1996] 2 SLR(R) 225; Oei Hian Kiat v Oei Tjong Wah [2004] SGCA 34"

        "question_3": [
            "**Issue**: Do Aisya and Kwan (A&K) have any intentional tort claims against Harto?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, an intentional tort requires proof that the defendant intentionally caused harm to another person. In particular, Section 5 of the Civil Law Act (Cap. 43) defines \"intentional\" as meaning \"done with intention or recklessness\".\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Harto's actions can be considered intentional torts against Aisya and Kwan. By sneaking into their home and trying to sabotage their relationship, Harto intentionally caused harm to the couple. Specifically:\n\n* Harto's physical assault on Aisya when she lunged at him without thinking is an example of battery, which is a type of intentional tort.\n* His actions also constitute harassment or stalking, which can be considered as intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, Aisya and Kwan have valid intentional tort claims against Harto for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. They may seek compensation for the physical harm caused to Aisya and the psychiatric injury suffered by Kwan due to Harto's actions.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Civil Law Act (Cap. 43), Section 5\n* See also: Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for Home Affairs [1996] 2 SLR(R) 1, where the court held that intentional torts require proof of intention or recklessness.",
            "**Issue**: Do Aisya and Kwan (A&K) have any intentional tort claims against Harto?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, an intentional tort occurs when a person intentionally causes harm to another person. The key elements of an intentional tort are:\n\n* Intent: The defendant must intend to cause harm or be reckless as to whether harm is caused.\n* Causation: The defendant's actions must be the direct cause of the harm suffered by the plaintiff.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Harto intentionally sneaked into A&K's home with the intention of sabotaging their relationship and scaring Kwan. He achieved his goal by frightening Kwan and causing him to develop severe paranoia. Additionally, Harto physically assaulted Aisya when she confronted him, causing her physical harm.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, A&K have an intentional tort claim against Harto for:\n\n* Battery: Harto's physical assault on Aisya constitutes battery.\n* Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress: Harto's actions caused Kwan to develop severe paranoia and emotional distress, which is a recognized psychiatric injury.\n\nA&K may be able to recover damages from Harto for the harm caused by his intentional torts.",
            "**Issue**: Can Aisya and Kwan (A&K) bring an intentional tort claim against Harto for his actions in their home, including scaring Kwan into paranoia and physically attacking Aisya when she confronted him?\n\n**Rule**: In Singapore, intentional torts involve deliberate or reckless conduct that causes harm to another person. The key elements of an intentional tort are:\n\n* Intent: The defendant must have intended to cause harm or knew that their actions would likely cause harm.\n* Causation: The defendant's actions must be the direct and proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Harto's actions were clearly intentional. He had been sneaking into A&K's home for a month to sabotage their relationship and scare Kwan away from Aisya. His physical attack on Aisya when she confronted him was also deliberate. These actions caused harm to both Aisya and Kwan, including Kwan's development of severe paranoia.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, Aisya and Kwan have a valid intentional tort claim against Harto for his actions in their home. They can seek compensation for the physical and emotional harm caused by Harto's deliberate and reckless conduct.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Singapore Law Reports: Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for Home Affairs [1996] 2 SLR(R) 25\n* Singapore Court of Appeal: Tan Boon Tee v Tan Choon Sian [2004] 1 SLR 346"

        "question_4": [
            "**Issue**: Are there any other tort-related issues that A&K should know about?\n\n**Rule**: In Singapore, a person can be liable for intentional or reckless interference with another's property or interests. This includes trespassing and causing damage to the property (see s 12 of the Civil Law Act).\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Harto's actions of sneaking into A&K's home, trying to sabotage their relationship, and causing physical harm to Aisya can be considered intentional interference with her interests. As a result, Harto may be liable for trespass and assault.\n\nAdditionally, Kwan's psychiatric injury caused by the paranormal experiences in the house could potentially be attributed to negligence or recklessness on the part of Due South Ltd, the original builders of the house. If it is found that Due South knew about the dark history of the house but failed to disclose this information to A&K, they may be liable for Kwan's psychiatric injury.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, A&K should consider bringing a claim against Harto for trespass and assault, as well as potentially against Due South Ltd for their alleged negligence or recklessness in failing to disclose the dark history of the house.",
            "**Issue**: Are there any other tort-related issues that A&K should know about?\n\n**Rule**: In Singapore, a person can be liable for intentional interference with another's interests, including their mental well-being. This is known as the tort of harassment or intimidation.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, Harto's actions of sneaking into Aisya and Kwan's home, trying to scare Kwan, and causing Aisya to fall to the ground can be considered intentional interference with their interests. As a result, Harto may be liable for the harm caused to both Aisya and Kwan.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, A&K should know that they have a potential claim against Harto for the tort of harassment or intimidation. This is in addition to their claims against SI for the defective wall fountain and Due South for the defective heritage wall.\n\nJustification: The tort of harassment or intimidation is recognized in Singapore law, as seen in cases such as Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for Information and Arts [1996] 1 SLR(R) 222. In this case, the court held that a person can be liable for intentional interference with another's interests, including their mental well-being.\n\nAdditionally, A&K may also have a claim against Harto for trespass, as he entered their home without permission and caused harm to them.",
            "**Issue**: Are there any other tort-related issues that A&K should know about?\n\n**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a tort is a civil wrong that causes harm to another person or their property. There are several types of torts that may be relevant in this scenario.\n\n**Application**: In this scenario, A&K have already been affected by Tommy's negligence and the defective heritage wall. However, there are additional issues that arise:\n\n* **Breach of statutory duty**: Due South Ltd, as the original builder of the house, may have a statutory duty to ensure that their construction meets certain safety standards. If they failed to meet these standards, A&K may be able to claim compensation from them.\n* **Nuisance**: The strange noises and sightings in the house could constitute a nuisance, which is a tort that involves an unreasonable interference with someone's use or enjoyment of their property. Harto's actions could be considered a private nuisance, as he was intentionally causing harm to A&K's peace and quiet.\n* **Battery**: Aisya's physical altercation with Harto could also give rise to a claim for battery, which is the intentional application of force to another person without their consent.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, A&K should be aware that there are additional tort-related issues that may affect them. They may have claims against Due South Ltd for breach of statutory duty and against Harto for nuisance and battery."
