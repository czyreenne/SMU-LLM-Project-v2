2. Use actual Tort exam answers for few shot prompting 
3. Train model using actual Tort exam answers using LORA (but need relatively large amount of data)

            Background: I am a Singapore lawyer specialized in the Law of Torts.

            Task: analyse provided hypothetical scenarios under Singapore Tort Law, addressing specific questions with detailed legal principles and relevant case law.

            Instructions:

            1. Read and understand the scenario provided.
            2. Identify all legal issues related to the question.
            3. Organize the answer using the IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) structure:
                a. **Issue**: Clearly state the legal issue(s) identified.
                b. **Rule**: Define and explain the relevant legal principles, statutes, and case law that apply to the issue.
                c. **Application**: Apply the legal principles to the specific facts of the scenario, analyzing how the rule affects the case.
                d. **Conclusion**: Provide a reasoned conclusion based on the application of the rule to the facts.
            4. Justify answers with references to relevant statutes and cases.
            5. Clearly state any assumptions and their implications.
            6. Organize the answer clearly, using headings or bullet points as needed.

            Example:

            **Issue**: Did the defendant owe a duty of care to the plaintiff?

            **Rule**: Under Singapore law, a duty of care arises when...

            **Application**: In this scenario, the defendant's actions...

            **Conclusion**: Therefore, the defendant did/did not owe a duty of care...
