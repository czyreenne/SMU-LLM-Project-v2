The\nplatform was founded 6 years ago and is based in Singapore. Its main selling point is a\nrange of AR \ufb01lters called \u2014 \u201cperspectives\u201d or \u201cpaxes\u201d by the community \u2014 which let\nstreamers superimpose hyper-realistic 3D graphics over real world video. These can be\nactivated at the click of a button, and streamers generally do not concern themselves with\nhow they work.\nThe platform rose to fame because of its dedication towards helping its creators make con-\ntent (and money) \u201clike magic\u201d. Since the beginning, Witch maintained a \u201ccreator \ufb01rst\u201d\npolicy which very publicly declares that all subscription fees \u201cgo directly in the \ufb01rst in-\nstance to our content creators; we only take a modest amount to keep the platform run-\nning\u201d. This modest amount is 10% of the subscription fee viewers pay. Creators alone\ndecide how much to set these fees at. In this regard, Witch differs from usual platforms\nwhere, in those other platforms, (1) viewer money goes \ufb01rst to the platform which takes\na cut before disbursing funds to the streamer\u2019s account, (2) average platform fees range\nbetween 20\u201330%; and (3) creators are required to charge an amount the platform sets.\nThe relationship between Witch and its creators is shaped by Witch\u2019s Terms of Use which\nbinds both creators and viewers alike. The Terms state that Witch is \u201cnot responsible for\nany content our creators publish on our platform\u201d. Nothing else in the Terms is material.\nAs for Marcela, her success really began in October last year, when she decided to do\na Halloween special. She streamed herself taking a walk through Bishan-Ang Mo Kio\npark at night while using one of Witch\u2019s \u201chorror\u201d paxes to make it seem as if every other\nhuman in the park was some kind of nightly horror \u2014 zombies, werewolves, giants, beasts,\nvampires, and ghosts galore. That stream attracted 50,000 active viewers.\nBut all that was last year. Since then, Marcela has organised her channel around horror\nstreams: night visits to the abandoned Old Changi Hospital, mysterious spots in Pulau\nUbin, etc, all of them enhanced by Witch\u2019s paxes. This has won her dedicated subscriber\nbase amongst Singapore teens aged 14\u201320, who enjoy watching her streams with friends\nat sleepovers and the like.\n AY2022/23-I\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n3\nCapitalising on her success, on 12 August 2022 Marcela planned a huge \u201cSeventh Month\nSpecial\u201d. This coincided with the \ufb01rst day of the Lunar seventh month, a date broadly\nunderstood in Chinese superstition as the day the gates of the Underworld open, allowing\nits denizens to roam the world of the living. Marcela asked Witch if they could make her\na \u201cspecial, extra scary Seventh Month pax which shows extremely realistic ghosts \ufb02ying\neverywhere, so that my subscribers get the fright of their lives\u201d. Witch readily agreed, as it\nwas raring to try out a new AR generation software its engineers had just \ufb01nished building.\nMarcela marketed the event aggressively on her channel, asking her viewers to \u201cinvite all\nyour friends and non-believers to come and witness the true meaning of horror (at your\nown risk!)\u201d.\nMarcela then set herself up on 11 August 2022, 2300 hours, in the middle of Lim Chu\nKang cemetery. Together with her viewers, she counted down to midnight. By 2355\nhours, her stream had upwards of 250,000 viewers (not including those watching through\ntheir friends\u2019 accounts). Once the clock struck twelve, Marcela turned the new pax on.\nWhat transpired was truly the meaning of horror. It turned out that Witch\u2019s engineers had\nbuilt the new software by training a machine learning algorithm on particularly gruesome\nand grisly images \u2014 the sort that would be banned outright from television. This included\nreal images of dead, dismembered, and decaying humans and other (previously) living\nthings. That was how they were able to replicate hyper-realistic, and utterly frightful AR\nvisions. Witch did not realise that paxes created by this software had the potential to repro-\nduce the exact same images on their platform (in hyper-realistic 3D no less). Because of a\ncareless oversight on Witch\u2019s part, the new software did not go through quality assurance\nor censorship before deployment.\nThe moment the \ufb01lter was enabled, gory images in the software\u2019s training data were in-\nstantly broadcast to all of Marcela\u2019s viewers, in\ufb02icting severe distress and emotional dam-\nage. As she was busy \ufb01lming, Marcela did not realise what was happening until a sharp\nfall in viewer count minutes into the stream prompted her to check what they were seeing.\nShe immediately turned the \ufb01lter off when she did.\nBy then, however, the damage had been done. Marcela went from expecting 10,000 new\nsubscribers from that event to losing 250,000 subscribers overnight.\nThis causes her\nmonthly subscriber revenue to plunge by $250,000, as she charges $1/month. She also\n \nAnswer all the following questions using only material covered up till and not includ-\ning the Standard of Care. You also need not discuss anything to do with defences.\n1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n3. Other than negligence, are there any other tort(s) which Khan may use to sue Witch\nand/or Marcela?

If more facts\nare needed for your analysis, state them and explain why.\n AY2022/23-I\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n4\nhad to cancel planned specials for the rest of the Seventh Month. These, she estimates,\nwould have net her another 25,000 new subscribers. To make things worse, two months\nlater she gets a lawyer\u2019s letter from Khan, who had developed a recognised psychiatric\ninjury from watching her stream. Though she is completely \ufb01ne herself, Marcela suspects\nthat many other viewers could have come down with such psychiatric injuries as well.\n* * *\nAnswer all the following questions using only material covered up till and not includ-\ning the Standard of Care.

          "issues": "To address the legal questions derived from the hypothetical scenario involving Marcela, Witch, and Khan, we will first outline the key legal issues at stake:\n\n### 1. Duty of Care Owed by Witch to Marcela\n**Key Issues:**\n- **Existence of Duty**: Determine whether Witch, as the platform provider, owes Marcela a duty of care as a content creator using its platform. The key considerations in this analysis will include:\n  - **Proximity**: The nature of the relationship between Witch and Marcela (i.e., user and provider).\n  - **Foreseeability**: Whether it was foreseeable that the deployment of the AR filter could cause emotional distress to Marcela, who had staked her reputation and income on her streaming content.\n  - **Policy Considerations**: Whether there are broader policy reasons for or against recognizing a duty of care in this context. Courts often consider whether imposing a duty would lead to unintended consequences, such as an influx of similar claims or breaching the commercial dynamics of content creation.\n\n### 2. Duty of Care Owed by Witch and Marcela to Khan\n**Key Issues:**\n- **Existence of Duty**: Assess if either Witch or Marcela owed a duty of care to Khan at the time of streaming. The factors to consider include:\n  - **Foreseeability of Harm**: The potential of causing psychiatric injury to viewers (like Khan) from witnessing disturbing content without prior warning.\n  - **Proximity to the Viewer**: Evaluate the direct and indirect relationships between the streamer, the platform, and the viewers, including the type of content streamed and viewer expectations.\n  - **Causation**: Examine whether any breach of duty by Witch or Marcela was the cause of Khan's psychiatric injury and if it was foreseeable that a viewer could suffer such an injury from the stream.\n\n### 3. Other Torts Apart from Negligence\n**Key Issues:**\n- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress**: Analyze whether the actions of either Witch or Marcela could fall under this tort. Elements that would need to be established include:\n  - **Extreme and Outrageous Conduct**: Whether enabling the AR filter constituted conduct that was deemed extreme and outrageous beyond the bounds of decency.\n  - **Intent or Recklessness**: Intention behind the actions or disregard for the likelihood of causing harm to viewers.\n  - **Causation**: The link between the conduct of Marcela or Witch and the reported psychiatric injury suffered by Khan.\n\n- **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress**: This tort needs to be examined alongside negligence, focusing on:\n  - **Bystander Rule**: Whether Khan watched the stream in a manner akin to being a direct victim (i.e., watching the live stream).\n  - **Close Relational Proximity**: Determining if Khan's relationship with Marcela creates a sufficient basis for claiming emotional distress given the public nature of the stream.\n\nOverall, the analysis needs to navigate through the established principles of tort law under Singapore statutes and case law, focusing on doctrines revolving around duty of care, the thresholds of emotional distress claims and potential other torts. Each element of duty of care, foreseeability, and causation must be critically examined to provide a comprehensive solution to the posed queries.",
          "rules": "To analyze the original questions based on the hypothetical scenario involving Marcela, Witch, and Khan, we will consider the established legal principles in Singapore tort law regarding duty of care, foreseeable harm, and the potential claims apart from negligence.\n\n### 1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\n**Legal Framework:**\nThe determination of whether a duty of care exists starts with the three-part test established by the Singapore Court of Appeal in *Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science and Technology Agency [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100*. The elements are:\n\n- **Factual Foreseeability**: The defendant must have been able to foresee that the claimant would suffer damage from their act or omission.\n- **Proximity**: There must be a close and direct relationship between the parties.\n- **Policy Considerations**: The imposition of a duty of care should not raise insurmountable policy issues.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Factual Foreseeability**: It can be argued that Witch should have reasonably foreseen that the malfunction of the AR filter, particularly one designed to produce horror images, could adversely affect Marcela's reputation. As the platform host, Witch had a significant role in the experience that led to a negative outcome for Marcela.\n- **Proximity**: There exists a direct relationship between Witch and Marcela as the platform owner and content creator, respectively. Marcela relied heavily on Witch\u2019s platform, and the nature of the service implies a reliance on the platform's functionality and quality.\n- **Policy Considerations**: Courts may consider whether imposing such a duty would adversely affect commercial practices in the content creation industry; however, the relationship dynamics and financial stakes involved suggest that it would be reasonable to recognize a duty of care to prevent foreseeable harm to content creators like Marcela.\n\n**Conclusion**: It is plausible that Witch owes Marcela a duty of care, given the foreseeable risk of harm and the close relationship stemming from their contractual arrangement and the nature of their business dealings.\n\n### 2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n\n**Legal Framework:**\nAs discussed, the *Spandeck* framework applies here as well. The court must analyze both foreseeability and proximity.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Factual Foreseeability**: The gruesome content delivered via the AR filter was extreme, which raises questions about whether it was foreseeable that viewers like Khan would suffer psychiatric harm from experiencing such content. Given the sensationalism associated with horror content and the marketing by Marcela, it may be argued that viewers were sufficiently warned (albeit lightly) of the potential for distress.\n- **Proximity**: Khan's relationship to Marcela as a viewer is indirect, but he was a participant in real time. The proximity standard may be argued to be more robust when considering the heightened emotional responses associated with viewing graphic horror content, especially within cultural contexts that amplify those fears.\n- **Causation**: If it can be shown that Witch or Marcela\u2019s actions directly led to Khan's psychiatric injury (i.e., the content being so extreme as to cause significant distress), then liability may be more feasible. However, given the nature of live streaming and audience expectations, establishing a direct line of causation may be challenging.\n\n**Conclusion**: There exists a reasonable argument that both Witch and Marcela could owe Khan a duty of care, particularly if the court acknowledges the emotional impacts anticipated from the type of content streamed.\n\n### 3. Other than negligence, are there any other tort(s) which Khan may use to sue Witch and/or Marcela?\n\n**Legal Framework:**\nTwo notable torts potentially applicable are **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)** and **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED)**. \n\n**Analysis**:\n- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress**: For this tort, Khan would need to establish:\n  - Extreme and outrageous conduct: The deployment of hyper-realistic horror images without warning may qualify as extreme, especially considering the cultural sensitivities surrounding the Seventh Month.\n  - Intent or recklessness: If it can be argued that Witch acted with a reckless disregard for the consequences of their actions, or that Marcela intended to shock or offend her audience, this tort might be successfully established.\n  - Causation: As with negligence, establishing a clear connection between the conduct and Khan's distress is critical.\n\n- **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress**: The elements include:\n  - Bystander rule: Given that Khan watched the stream live, he may qualify as a direct victim.\n  - Close relational proximity: The public nature of the stream dilutes some aspects of relational proximity concerns; however, evidence of Khan\u2019s personal stake in the content (whether he was a fan of Marcela or closely followed her work) could strengthen his case.\n\n**Conclusion**: Khan may have viable claims for IIED and NIED against either Marcela or Witch, depending on the court's assessment of the emotional distress caused by the content streamed and the actions of both parties leading up to that moment. Both torts warrant exploration if negligence claims alone may not sufficiently capture the emotional harm suffered.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe analysis presents a compelling case that Witch may owe Marcela a duty of care in light of foreseeable risks to her professional standing as a content creator. There is also a plausible duty of care owed to Khan given the psychological impact of the harmful content on viewers. Furthermore, alternative tort claims of IIED and NIED might be pursued to encapsulate the emotional distress experienced by Khan. Each element\u2014duty, foreseeability, and the nature of the conduct\u2014requires a meticulous assessment by the court, should this matter proceed to litigation.",
          "analysis": "### Analysis of the Hypothetical Scenario Involving Marcela, Witch, and Khan\n\nIn the provided scenario, several legal issues arise under Singapore tort law regarding the potential for claims based on negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The responses to the questions address the various duties of care owed and the applicable tort concepts in this unique context.\n\n#### 1. **Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?**\n\n**Legal Framework:**\nThe *Spandeck Engineering* case forms the basis of the test to establish a duty of care. The three criteria necessary for determining the existence of a duty are:\n- **Factual Foreseeability:** The defendant should have foreseen that the claimant might suffer damage from their actions.\n- **Proximity:** There should be a close relationship between the claimant and defendant.\n- **Policy Considerations:** There should not be overwhelming policy reasons against imposing a duty.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Factual Foreseeability:** Witch should have reasonably foreseen that utilizing an AR filter designed to depict horror could lead to reputational damage for a streamer like Marcela, particularly when the filter malfunctioned and caused distress among viewers. Given Marcela\u2019s established fanbase and commercial reliance on her platform, it is evident that adverse outcomes could emerge from a malfunctioning tool created by Witch.\n  \n- **Proximity:** The relationship between Witch and Marcela can be characterized as sufficiently proximate; Witch provides a platform for content creation to Marcela, who relies on it for her livelihood. Their contractual arrangement implicates a level of dependence that establishes a close relationship warranting duty of care.\n\n- **Policy Considerations:** While concerns about the commercial implications of imposing duties on platform providers could surface, the necessity to protect creators like Marcela from foreseeable harm seems paramount. This scenario does not suggest overwhelming policy implications that would warrant denying a duty of care.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on this analysis, it is reasonable to assert that Witch does owe a duty of care to Marcela, given the foreseeable risks associated with the malfunctioning AR filter and their close contractual relationship.\n\n#### 2. **Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?**\n\n**Legal Framework:**\nAgain, the *Spandeck* framework applies for determining the duty of care between Witch/Marcela and Khan.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Factual Foreseeability:** The use of a graphic AR filter in a horror-themed live stream raises questions regarding foreseeability of harm. It is arguable that it should be foreseeable that viewers, particularly those sensitive to graphic content or cultural beliefs regarding horror themes, could suffer psychiatric distress when exposed to such extreme imagery.\n\n- **Proximity:** Khan's relationship to Marcela is more tenuous than that of a direct viewer. However, as a live participant in the stream, he may be classified under the 'bystander' rule, allowing him a degree of proximity. The intensity of the streamed content and its potential emotional impact supports an argument for a duty of care.\n\n- **Causation:** Causation might be more challenging to establish. If the broadcasted images directly correlate with Khan\u2019s psychiatric injury, one could argue that Witch\u2019s role in providing the technology and Marcela\u2019s decision to use such a filter bear significant responsibility.\n\n**Conclusion:** There exists a compelling argument that both Witch and Marcela owe a duty of care to Khan. The extreme nature of the streamed content and its unforeseen consequences could lead to claims of duty due to the foreseeable emotional distress inflicted on viewers.\n\n#### 3. **Other than negligence, are there any other tort(s) which Khan may use to sue Witch and/or Marcela?**\n\n**Legal Framework:**\nKhan may potentially bring forth claims under **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)** and **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED)**.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED):** For a successful claim, Khan must establish:\n    - **Extreme and Outrageous Conduct:** The nature of the hyper-realistic graphics could potentially qualify as extreme and outrageous given the cultural significance and superstitions around the Seventh Month in Chinese culture. This could be argued as willful disregard for viewers\u2019 emotional responses.\n    - **Intent or Recklessness:** If either Witch or Marcela could be seen as intentionally pushing the boundaries for views, it may support an IIED claim.\n\n- **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED):** Khan's claim under NIED could focus on:\n    - **Bystander Rule Application:** Since Khan viewed the live stream in real-time, his case may align with cases where a viewer suffers distress through the actions of a defendant. \n    - **Close Relational Proximity:** Although his direct relationship with Marcela is not as strong, the nature of live streaming could amplify feelings of connectedness that courts might consider.\n\n**Conclusion:** Khan potentially has viable tort claims in IIED and NIED against both Witch and Marcela due to the nature of the extreme content and the corresponding emotional response it engendered. Each claim would require careful factual analysis at trial to ascertain the extent of liability.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe analysis indicates that Witch owes Marcela a duty of care due to the foreseeable impacts arising from their professional relationship. Similarly, both Witch and Marcela likely bear responsibilities for the presumed psychological distress experienced by viewers like Khan due to tortious conduct. Apart from traditional negligence claims, alternatives such as IIED and NIED present further avenues for Khan to seek redress. It is essential for these issues to be factually scrutinized in court to establish liabilities appropriately. Each component (duty, foreseeability, and conduct) requires thorough examination, especially if the case proceeds to litigation.",
          "conclusion": "### Analysis of the Hypothetical Scenario Involving Marcela, Witch, and Khan\n\n**1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?**\n\n**Legal Framework:**\nThe determination of whether Witch owes Marcela a duty of care will follow the three-part test outlined in *Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science and Technology Agency [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100*, namely:\n- **Factual Foreseeability**: Whether Witch could foresee that their actions might cause harm or damage to Marcela.\n- **Proximity**: The closeness of the relationship between the parties.\n- **Policy Considerations**: Whether any significant policy reasons would negate the imposition of a duty of care.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Factual Foreseeability**: It is foreseeable that a malfunctioning AR filter, particularly one designed to project horror images, could lead to emotional distress and reputational harm for a content creator like Marcela. Given her professional reliance on the platform for income and reputation, it is reasonable to assert that negative outcomes from a poorly developed product should have been anticipated by Witch.\n  \n- **Proximity**: The relationship between Witch and Marcela is characterized by a clear commercial and dependent dynamic. Marcela relies on Witch\u2019s platform for her livelihood and audience engagement; thus, their relationship is sufficiently proximate.\n\n- **Policy Considerations**: Imposing a duty of care in this context likely aligns with policy considerations aimed at protecting content creators, although Witch might argue that doing so could lead to complications and affect its business model negatively. However, the risk that this relationship could harm Marcela outweighs such concerns.\n\n**Conclusion**: It is reasonable to conclude that Witch owes Marcela a duty of care, considering the foreseeable risks associated with the deployment of untested technology and the close professional relationship they share.\n\n---\n\n**2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?**\n\n**Legal Framework:**\nThe *Spandeck* framework also applies here to determine if either Witch or Marcela owes a duty of care to Khan, the viewer.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Factual Foreseeability**: Given the nature of the content streamed (graphic horror images), it is foreseeable that viewers with sensitivities to such material could suffer psychiatric harm. The cultural context surrounding the \"Seventh Month\" adds an additional layer of foreseeability concerning viewer susceptibility to fear and distress.\n\n- **Proximity**: Khan's relationship with Marcela as a viewer could be approached through the concept of proximity. Although it may not be as direct as a creator's responsibility to their audience, the live nature of streaming creates an \"immediate\" viewer experience. Additionally, in contemporary online media, viewers may feel a closer connection to content creators, increasing the likelihood of emotional impact.\n\n- **Causation**: Establishing causation might be a challenge. However, if it can be shown that the elements of horror actually triggered Khan's psychiatric distress, a reasonable connection could be made between the conduct of both Witch and Marcela and Khan\u2019s resulting condition.\n\n**Conclusion**: There is a well-founded argument that both Witch and Marcela could owe Khan a duty of care due to the sheer nature of the disturbing content exhibited and the context in which it was presented.\n\n---\n\n**3. Other than negligence, are there any other tort(s) which Khan may use to sue Witch and/or Marcela?**\n\n**Legal Framework:**\nKhan may consider claims under **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)** and **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED)**.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)**:\n    - **Extreme and Outrageous Conduct**: The graphic horror elements, especially created for a culturally sensitive event, may indeed be viewed as extreme, particularly given the context of the stream and the expectations set by Marcela\u2019s marketing.\n    - **Intent or Recklessness**: It must be determined if Marcela or Witch knowingly disregarded the potential for harm in pursuing sensationalism for views. This could establish a basis for IIED.\n\n- **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED)**:\n    - If Khan viewed the stream live, he might fall within the \u201cbystander\u201d rule, increasing his chances to recover under NIED principles, assuming that he suffered a recognized psychiatric injury due to watching the horror unfold without adequate warning.\n    - **Close Relational Proximity**: While there's an indirect relationship, the immersive experience of live streaming may provide sufficient proximity for evaluation under this tort, especially if Khan's emotional detachment from the content manifested through a direct emotional response.\n\n**Conclusion**: Khan potentially has a viable claim for both IIED and NIED against Marcela and Witch based on the extreme nature of the content and the emotional impact it had on him. \n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThis hypothetical scenario presents numerous considerations under tort law that highlight the complexities of duties owed in emerging digital contexts. Witch appears to owe Marcela a clear duty of care, reflecting the reliance and expectations within the creator-platform relationship. Simultaneously, both Witch and Marcela potentially owe a duty to Khan due to the foreseeable emotional distress posed by the content. In addition to negligence, other torts such as IIED and NIED may provide Khan pathways for legal redress given the severe ramifications stemming from the live stream incident. Each aspect should be rigorously evaluated during litigation, as the nuances of digital content creation intertwine significantly with tort principles."

          "issues": "### Legal Analysis of the Hypothetical Scenario Involving Marcela and the Platform \"Witch\"\n\nIn this scenario, we need to consider several legal issues that arise following the events during the AR streaming incident involving Marcela, the streamer, and the platform \"Witch\". The key questions are whether Witch owes a duty of care to Marcela, whether either Witch or Marcela owe a duty of care to Khan, and the potential for tort claims other than negligence.\n\n#### 1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- **Existence of a Relationship:** The initial issue is whether there exists a legally recognized relationship between Witch and Marcela that gives rise to a duty of care. In tort law, a duty of care typically arises where one party has a particular relationship with another, often characterized by proximity and foreseeability of harm.\n  \n- **Nature of the Duty:** Witch operates a platform that allows creators like Marcela to stream content using their technology. The nature of this relationship suggests that Witch has obligations to ensure that their platform, and particularly the technology it provides (in this case, the AR filters), is safe for its users. While Witch's Terms of Use state it is \"not responsible for any content our creators publish,\" this does not absolve it from ensuring that its technology does not produce harmful content.\n\n- **Foreseeability of Harm:** Given that the AR filters were supposed to be entertaining and enhance Marcela\u2019s streams, it is foreseeable that deploying a filter that inadvertently broadcasts graphic or distressing images could cause harm, particularly when used in a horror context.\n\n- **Conclusion on Duty of Care:** Based on the relationship between Witch and Marcela as a creator using its platform, and the foreseeability of harm arising from the technology used, it is likely that Witch owes a duty of care to Marcela. This duty includes ensuring that the technology does not inadvertently produce harmful or distressing content that could affect Marcela's audience.\n\n#### 2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- **Duty of Care to Viewers:** In terms of duty owed to Khan, a viewer who suffered emotional distress as a result of the stream, the court would evaluate whether Witch or Marcela had a duty to protect viewers from the risk of psychological harm.\n\n- **Witch\u2019s Position:** Witch, being the provider of the technology, may owe a duty of care to viewers in ensuring that its filters do not produce harmful content. This is grounded in the principle that content creators and platforms must consider the impact of their offerings on third parties, particularly in an emotionally charged context such as horror streaming.\n\n- **Marcela's Position:** As the creator who activated the filter, Marcela might also bear some responsibility for the content she chose to present. However, the likelihood that she could foresee the specific graphic nature of the images produced by the filter may be limited, especially if she was not aware of the underlying data used to train the algorithm.\n\n- **Conclusion on Duty to Khan:** Both Witch and Marcela may owe a duty of care to Khan due to the foreseeable risk of emotional distress arising from the broadcasted content. However, the extent of that duty and liability will depend on the court\u2019s interpretation of foreseeability and the relationship between the parties.\n\n#### 3. Other than negligence, are there any other tort(s) which Khan may use to sue Witch and/or Marcela?\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- **Nuisance:** Khan could potentially argue that the stream constituted a nuisance if the conduct was deemed to cause substantial and unreasonable interference with a right to enjoyment of life (such as being subjected to traumatic imagery).\n\n- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED):** This is a potential claim if it can be shown that either Marcela or Witch acted with outrageous conduct that foreseeably caused severe emotional distress to viewers. While proving IIED can be challenging, if the streaming incident is considered a gross violation of acceptable norms, it could fit the criteria.\n\n- **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED):** This tort is relevant if Khan is able to demonstrate that he suffered a recognizable psychiatric injury due to the negligence of either Witch or Marcela in their handling of the streaming content.\n\n- **Conclusion on Other Torts:** In addition to negligence, there are viable alternative torts that Khan may explore, such as nuisance, IIED, or NIED, depending on the specific facts surrounding his claim and the impacts of the distress he experienced.\n\n### Final Summary\n\n- **Witch owes Marcela a duty of care** primarily based on the nature of their relationship and the foreseeability of harm from the AR technology.\n- **Witch and Marcela may both owe a duty of care to Khan**, the viewer who suffered emotional distress, due to the inadvertent broadcast of graphic content.\n- **Alternative tort claims** such as nuisance, IIED, and NIED are potential avenues for Khan if he seeks redress beyond simple negligence claims.",
          "rules": "### Revised Legal Analysis of the Hypothetical Scenario Involving Marcela and the Platform \"Witch\"\n\nIn this analysis, we will elucidate the legal implications surrounding the incident involving Marcela, the streamer, and the platform \"Witch\". The assessment will cover whether Witch owes Marcela a duty of care, whether either Witch or Marcela owe a duty of care to Khan, and explore potential tort claims available to Khan beyond negligence.\n\n#### 1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\n**Legal Framework:**\n- **Establishing Duty of Care:** In Australia\u2019s common law, the concept of duty of care arises primarily from the principles enunciated in *Donoghue v. Stevenson* and further defined through the *Caparo* test, although there is no singular test universally adopted. Generally, the existence of a duty of care hinges on three factors: foreseeability of harm, a close proximity relationship, and that it is fair and reasonable to impose a duty.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Existence of a Relationship:** Marcela's use of Witch as a streaming platform establishes a special relationship. The platform provides technology that directly facilitates her content creation, and this reliance constitutes a degree of proximity.\n  \n- **Foreseeability of Harm:** Witch launched a special AR filter specifically for Marcela\u2019s horror-themed streaming, which can reasonably be expected to engage a specific viewer demographic, potentially drawing individuals unprepared for extreme horror. The deployment of technology that can produce distressing imagery strongly indicates that harm could be foreseen.\n\n- **Nature of the Duty:** Given Witch\u2019s explicit role in providing streaming technology and the protective responsibilities that come with it (to both creators and audiences), it can be inferred that Witch carries an obligation to ensure that its filters do not inadvertently inflict harm, particularly when prior knowledge of the software's capabilities (or lack thereof) is established.\n\n**Conclusion on Duty of Care:** Witch likely owes a duty of care to Marcela that encompasses the responsibility to employ measures ensuring the AR filters do not project harmful or distressing content. \n\n#### 2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n\n**Legal Framework:**\n- **Duty to Bystanders:** Courts have acknowledged that within the tort of negligence, a duty may be owed to a third party, especially when emotional distress is concerned. Duty of care can be established when harm is foreseeable and arises from a close relationship between the parties. \n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Witch\u2019s Position:** As the provider of the technology responsible for the streamed content, Witch likely has a significant duty to safeguard against the likelihood of third-party emotional harm from its AR filters. There exists a foreseeable risk that distressing imagery could adversely affect viewers, making it reasonable to suggest that Witch has a duty of care to them, including Khan.\n\n- **Marcela\u2019s Position:** While Marcela instigated the use of the filter, her decision-making may be tempered by the gravity of the impacts of the filter, which she believed to be safe as articulated by her approach to the content she streams. Marcela's liability would hinge on whether she could foresee the specific graphic nature of the images and their potential effect on viewers.\n\n**Conclusion on Duty to Khan:** Both Witch and Marcela may owe a duty of care to Khan, primarily grounded in the foreseeability of emotional distress originating from the broadcast of graphic imagery to viewers. This duty is also reinforced by the scale of the audience and the nature of the horror content.\n\n#### 3. Other than negligence, are there any other tort(s) which Khan may use to sue Witch and/or Marcela?\n\n**Legal Framework:**\n- Aside from negligence, potential tort claims may encompass nuisance, intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), and negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED).\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Nuisance:** Khan could assert that the AR stream represented a nuisance, as it constituted an unreasonable interference with his right to enjoy leisure activities without facing traumatic experiences, especially given the context of a horror stream.\n\n- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED):** Should Marcela or Witch be deemed to have acted in a manner that was so outrageous that it inflicted severe emotional distress on viewers, Khan could succeed in an IIED claim. Proving this would require demonstrating the conduct fell below acceptable societal norms pertaining to sensitivity in media entertainment.\n\n- **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED):** Khan could pursue this claim by establishing a recognizable psychiatric injury stemming from the negligent oversight in the implementation of the AR technology. This would necessitate evidence demonstrating the emotional harm linked to the negligence of either Witch or Marcela in allowing distressing content to be shown.\n\n**Conclusion on Other Torts:** In addition to negligence, tort claims such as nuisance, IIED, and NIED present plausible avenues for Khan to explore against Witch and/or Marcela. The viability of these claims would rest on the specifics of how the events unfolded during the streaming incident and the emotional impacts it had on Khan and other viewers.\n\n### Final Summary\n\n- **Witch likely owes Marcela a duty of care** stemming from the relationship and foreseeability of harm from the AR technology.\n- **Witch and Marcela may both owe a duty of care to Khan** due to the potential for emotional distress caused by the graphic content during the stream.\n- **Alternative tort claims**, including nuisance, IIED, and NIED, are available to Khan beyond traditional negligence. The success of these claims will hinge greatly on the specifics of the actual harm caused and the foreseeability of the impact on viewers.",
          "analysis": "### Legal Analysis of the Hypothetical Scenario Involving Marcela and the Platform \"Witch\"\n\nIn this analysis, we aim to address whether Witch owes Marcela a duty of care, whether either Witch or Marcela owes Khan, a viewer, a duty of care, and explore potential tort claims available to Khan beyond negligence.\n\n#### 1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\n**Legal Framework:**\n- The determination of a duty of care in Australian tort law usually draws from the principles laid out in *Donoghue v. Stevenson*, as interpreted in subsequent cases. The concept involves a relationship characterized by proximity, foreseeability of harm, and whether it is fair and reasonable to impose a duty.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Existence of a Relationship:** Marcela's continuous use of Witch's platform to create content indicates a commercial relationship strikingly different from mere platform consumption. Witch provides the technology enabling her streams, thus creating a proximity-based relationship where dependence on technological safety is paramount.\n  \n- **Foreseeability of Harm:** Given that Witch established a bespoke AR filter for Marcela's horror-themed content, it is reasonable to assert that Witch foresaw the risk of distress associated with deploying horror-themed imagery. Producing hyper-realistic images built from inappropriate training data heightens this risk, as it directly affected users.\n\n- **Nature of the Duty:** Witch\u2019s proactive commitment to fostering a \"creator-first\" environment suggests an obligation to ensure that their technology does not inadvertently expose users to graphic or distressing content. This responsibility extends to the need for appropriate quality assurance measures before deploying any experimental features.\n\n**Conclusion on Duty of Care:** Based on the characteristics of the relationship and the foreseeability of harm, it is likely that Witch owes Marcela a duty of care encompassing a responsibility to ensure that their AR filters are safe and do not project harmful content.\n\n#### 2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n\n**Legal Framework:**\n- Under Australian tort law, a duty of care to bystanders (in this case, viewers) can arise when damage is foreseeable, particularly if a close relationship exists or if the harm suffered is emotional in nature. \n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Witch\u2019s Position:** Witch's role in providing the AR filters and the resultant failure to ensure they were safe for use indicates a potential duty of care to viewers, including Khan. Given the technology\u2019s primary application in potentially distressing content, the foreseeable risk extends to viewers experiencing emotional distress from graphic imagery.\n\n- **Marcela\u2019s Position:** While Marcela activated the filter, her responsibility could be seen as mitigated by her reliance on Witch's assurances about the safety of the technology. Her direct intention was to entertain; thus, her ability to foresee the specific contagion of distress could be argued to be limited if she was unaware of the potential outputs of the filter\u2019s programming.\n\n**Conclusion on Duty to Khan:** It is plausible that both Marcela and Witch owe a duty of care to Khan. This is based on the clear foreseeability of emotional distress from the broadcasted content. Each party's liability may depend on the specifics of their involvement and knowledge of the filter's nature.\n\n#### 3. Other than negligence, are there any other tort(s) which Khan may use to sue Witch and/or Marcela?\n\n**Legal Framework:**\n- Besides negligence, the possible torts include nuisance, intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), and negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED).\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Nuisance:** Khan may assert a claim of nuisance by arguing that the horror stream caused unreasonable interference with his enjoyment of his leisure activity, especially given the extreme nature of the content that led to psychological trauma.\n\n- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED):** If either party\u2019s actions were deemed sufficiently outrageous, and it can be shown that either Witch or Marcela enabled (or created the risk of creating) severe emotional harm through the stream, Khan might pursue this tort. The gross nature of the broadcast could support a claim of IIED, given the extreme distress caused.\n\n- **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED):** Khan could argue that he suffered a recognized psychiatric injury due to negligence in allowing harmful content to be streamed. Evidence would be required to demonstrate the link between the distress and the actions of either Witch or Marcela.\n\n**Conclusion on Other Torts:** Khan has valid potential tort claims beyond negligence, including nuisance, IIED, and NIED. The success of these claims will depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the stream incident and the subsequent emotional impacts on Khan and his peers.\n\n### Final Summary\n- **Witch likely owes Marcela a duty of care** focused on ensuring the safety of AR filters deployed on its platform.\n- **Witch and Marcela both may owe a duty of care to Khan**, given the foreseeable emotional distress stemming from the graphic content broadcasted.\n- **Alternative tort claims** including nuisance, IIED, and NIED present feasible avenues for Khan outside traditional negligence claims, with potential success hinging on the specifics of the situation.",
          "conclusion": "### Legal Analysis of the Hypothetical Scenario Involving Marcela and the Platform \"Witch\"\n\nThis analysis addresses the legal issues arising from the incident involving Marcela, a streamer, and the platform \"Witch\". The analysis focuses on three key areas: the duty of care owed by Witch to Marcela, the duty of care owed by either Witch or Marcela to Khan, a viewer who experienced emotional distress, and the potential torts available to Khan beyond negligence.\n\n#### 1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Relationship Between Parties:** A duty of care arises from a relationship characterized by proximity and foreseeability. Marcela's use of Witch\u2019s platform for streaming creates a commercial relationship whereby Marcela relies on the platform for technological facilitation and audience engagement. This establishes a foundational proximity.\n\n- **Foreseeability of Harm:** Given the design and intent behind the AR filters\u2014especially a custom filter meant for a horror-themed stream\u2014it is reasonable to foresee potential emotional distress or harm arising from the misuse or malfunction of such technology. Specifically, the deployment of gruesome imagery trained on inappropriate data without quality assurance significantly amplifies the risk of distress.\n\n- **Nature of the Duty:** With Witch\u2019s emphasis on a \"creator-first\" policy, it implies a level of responsibility to ensure the safety and effectiveness of its technology. Leaving a new, untested AR filter unregulated before broadcasting raises ethical and legal considerations regarding user safety.\n\n**Conclusion on Duty of Care:** It is reasonable to conclude that Witch owes Marcela a duty of care, encompassing the need to ensure that its technology, including AR filters, does not cause unintended harm to its users.\n\n#### 2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Witch's Duty to Viewers:** As the provider of the AR technology, Witch has a responsibility to prevent foreseeable emotional harm to viewers stemming from its filters. Given the extreme nature of the imagery produced and the context of horror streaming, it is highly foreseeable that emotional distress could occur.\n\n- **Marcela's Duty to Viewers:** While Marcela activated the filter, her position as a creator who relied on the platform's assurances regarding its safety complicates her direct liability. She likely did not consider the potential outputs of the new AR filter to be harmful based on her lack of insight into its programming and data training.\n\n**Conclusion on Duty to Khan:** Both Witch and Marcela likely owe a duty of care to Khan due to the foreseeable emotional distress arising from the graphic content broadcasted. Their respective obligations may differ based on their roles and knowledge concerning the filter's safety.\n\n#### 3. Other than negligence, are there any other tort(s) which Khan may use to sue Witch and/or Marcela?\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Nuisance:** Khan might assert a claim of nuisance, arguing that the horror stream constituted unreasonable interference with his right to enjoy recreational activities without encountering traumatic experiences. The extreme nature of the content supports this claim.\n\n- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED):** If it can be shown that either Witch or Marcela's actions were outrageous and directly caused severe emotional harm to viewers like Khan, then a claim for IIED may be pursued. The extreme graphic content could be deemed to fall outside societal norms of acceptable broadcasting.\n\n- **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED):** Khan may argue he suffered from a psychological injury resulting from negligent actions of Witch or Marcela in relation to how the filter was managed. He would need to demonstrate a clear link between the emotional harm experienced and the negligent behaviors involved in streaming harmful content.\n\n**Conclusion on Other Torts:** Khan has viable claims beyond negligence, including nuisance, IIED, and NIED. The success of these claims will hinge on carefully demonstrating the distress suffered and the defendants' roles in the events.\n\n### Final Summary:\n- **Witch likely owes a duty of care to Marcela**, focusing on ensuring the safety of AR filters on its platform.\n- **Both Witch and Marcela probably owe a duty of care to Khan**, given the foreseeable emotional distress from the broadcast of distressing content.\n- **Alternative tort claims** such as nuisance, IIED, and NIED offer Khan potential routes for recovery beyond negligence. The outcome will significantly depend on the specific facts and established emotional impacts resulting from the streaming incident."

The\nplatform was founded 6 years ago and is based in Singapore. Its main selling point is a\nrange of AR \ufb01lters called \u2014 \u201cperspectives\u201d or \u201cpaxes\u201d by the community \u2014 which let\nstreamers superimpose hyper-realistic 3D graphics over real world video. These can be\nactivated at the click of a button, and streamers generally do not concern themselves with\nhow they work.\nThe platform rose to fame because of its dedication towards helping its creators make con-\ntent (and money) \u201clike magic\u201d. Since the beginning, Witch maintained a \u201ccreator \ufb01rst\u201d\npolicy which very publicly declares that all subscription fees \u201cgo directly in the \ufb01rst in-\nstance to our content creators; we only take a modest amount to keep the platform run-\nning\u201d. This modest amount is 10% of the subscription fee viewers pay. Creators alone\ndecide how much to set these fees at. In this regard, Witch differs from usual platforms\nwhere, in those other platforms, (1) viewer money goes \ufb01rst to the platform which takes\na cut before disbursing funds to the streamer\u2019s account, (2) average platform fees range\nbetween 20\u201330%; and (3) creators are required to charge an amount the platform sets.\nThe relationship between Witch and its creators is shaped by Witch\u2019s Terms of Use which\nbinds both creators and viewers alike. The Terms state that Witch is \u201cnot responsible for\nany content our creators publish on our platform\u201d. Nothing else in the Terms is material.\nAs for Marcela, her success really began in October last year, when she decided to do\na Halloween special. She streamed herself taking a walk through Bishan-Ang Mo Kio\npark at night while using one of Witch\u2019s \u201chorror\u201d paxes to make it seem as if every other\nhuman in the park was some kind of nightly horror \u2014 zombies, werewolves, giants, beasts,\nvampires, and ghosts galore. That stream attracted 50,000 active viewers.\nBut all that was last year. Since then, Marcela has organised her channel around horror\nstreams: night visits to the abandoned Old Changi Hospital, mysterious spots in Pulau\nUbin, etc, all of them enhanced by Witch\u2019s paxes. This has won her dedicated subscriber\nbase amongst Singapore teens aged 14\u201320, who enjoy watching her streams with friends\nat sleepovers and the like.\n AY2022/23-I\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n3\nCapitalising on her success, on 12 August 2022 Marcela planned a huge \u201cSeventh Month\nSpecial\u201d. This coincided with the \ufb01rst day of the Lunar seventh month, a date broadly\nunderstood in Chinese superstition as the day the gates of the Underworld open, allowing\nits denizens to roam the world of the living. Marcela asked Witch if they could make her\na \u201cspecial, extra scary Seventh Month pax which shows extremely realistic ghosts \ufb02ying\neverywhere, so that my subscribers get the fright of their lives\u201d. Witch readily agreed, as it\nwas raring to try out a new AR generation software its engineers had just \ufb01nished building.\nMarcela marketed the event aggressively on her channel, asking her viewers to \u201cinvite all\nyour friends and non-believers to come and witness the true meaning of horror (at your\nown risk!)\u201d.\nMarcela then set herself up on 11 August 2022, 2300 hours, in the middle of Lim Chu\nKang cemetery. Together with her viewers, she counted down to midnight. By 2355\nhours, her stream had upwards of 250,000 viewers (not including those watching through\ntheir friends\u2019 accounts). Once the clock struck twelve, Marcela turned the new pax on.\nWhat transpired was truly the meaning of horror. It turned out that Witch\u2019s engineers had\nbuilt the new software by training a machine learning algorithm on particularly gruesome\nand grisly images \u2014 the sort that would be banned outright from television. This included\nreal images of dead, dismembered, and decaying humans and other (previously) living\nthings. That was how they were able to replicate hyper-realistic, and utterly frightful AR\nvisions. Witch did not realise that paxes created by this software had the potential to repro-\nduce the exact same images on their platform (in hyper-realistic 3D no less). Because of a\ncareless oversight on Witch\u2019s part, the new software did not go through quality assurance\nor censorship before deployment.\nThe moment the \ufb01lter was enabled, gory images in the software\u2019s training data were in-\nstantly broadcast to all of Marcela\u2019s viewers, in\ufb02icting severe distress and emotional dam-\nage. As she was busy \ufb01lming, Marcela did not realise what was happening until a sharp\nfall in viewer count minutes into the stream prompted her to check what they were seeing.\nShe immediately turned the \ufb01lter off when she did.\nBy then, however, the damage had been done. Marcela went from expecting 10,000 new\nsubscribers from that event to losing 250,000 subscribers overnight.\nThis causes her\nmonthly subscriber revenue to plunge by $250,000, as she charges $1/month. She also\n \nAnswer all the following questions using only material covered up till and not includ-\ning the Standard of Care. You also need not discuss anything to do with defences.\n1.

To make things worse, two months\nlater she gets a lawyer\u2019s letter from Khan, who had developed a recognised psychiatric\ninjury from watching her stream.

          "issues": "To analyze the hypothetical scenario involving Marcela, Witch, and Khan, distinct legal issues need to be addressed, focusing particularly on the law of torts and exploring the concept of duty of care within Singapore's legal framework.\n\n### 1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\n**Key Legal Issues**:\n- **Duty of Care**: The primary question is whether Witch, as a platform provider, owes a duty of care to its content creators, like Marcela. The duty of care in a negligence claim is determined through factual foreseeability and proximity, as established in the Spandeck Engineering framework:\n    - **Factual Foreseeability**: Whether Witch could foresee that using an inadequately tested AR filter could cause harm (both in terms of emotional distress and economic damage) to Marcela.\n    - **Proximity**: This concerns the relationship between Witch and Marcela, including reliance, control over the AR filter's quality, and the contractual terms binding their interaction.\n    - **Policy Considerations**: If establishing such a duty would impose unreasonable burdens on similar platforms or stifle innovation.\n\n- **Contractual Terms**: The terms stipulated that Witch is not responsible for the creators' content. Thus, exploring how this exclusion affects the potential duty of care is necessary.\n\n### 2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n\n**Key Legal Issues**:\n- **Duty of Care to Viewers**: Whether Witch or Marcela owe a duty of care to viewers like Khan, who allegedly suffered psychiatric harm from the content broadcast during the stream.\n    - **Factual Foreseeability**: Whether it was foreseeable that viewers could suffer psychiatric harm from such distressing AR projections.\n    - **Proximity**:\n        - **Witch's Role**: As the provider and developer of the AR filter, an analysis of their control over content distribution and potential liability for inadequate oversight.\n        - **Marcela's Role**: As the streamer promoting the event and using the specific filters, the extent of her duty toward her audience, especially with the warning to \"watch at your own risk.\"\n\n- **Policy Considerations**: Similar to the analysis for Marcela, consideration of the impact of imposing a duty on creators towards their audience and the balance between viewer protection and content moderation responsibility.\n\n### 3. Are there any other torts Khan may use to sue Witch and/or Marcela besides negligence?\n\n**Key Legal Issues**:\n- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress**: There might be an argument here if it can be shown that there was an intention to cause harm or a reckless disregard of the likelihood of harm.\n    - **Elements**: Conduct must be outrageous or egregious, causing severe emotional distress or harm.\n  \n- **Product Liability**: If Khan argues that the AR filter is a defective product, he could potentially explore whether this constitutes a basis for a strict liability claim.\n  \n- **Defamation**: This seems unlikely as the claim arises from personal distress rather than reputational damage, but clarity on the allegations can rule this out comprehensively.\n\nEach of these legal issues requires careful examination of the relationship dynamics, foreseeability of harm, the scope of the duty of care under Singapore tort law, and potential defences that might be advanced by the defendants based on the available facts. The factual matrix in this scenario indicates complex intersections between technology usage, content regulation, and user protections, making it ripe for detailed judicial exploration.",
          "rules": "To address the legal questions in this hypothetical scenario, it's essential to apply Singapore's legal principles concerning the law of torts, particularly focusing on the Spandeck framework for establishing a duty of care.\n\n### 1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\n**Duty of Care Framework:**\n- **Factual Foreseeability:**\n  - **Analysis:** It must be considered whether Witch could reasonably foresee that using an inadequately tested AR filter could result in harm to its content creators like Marcela. Given the knowledge of the AR filter's potentially distressing nature without undergoing quality assurance, it could indeed be reasonably foreseeable that Marcela\u2019s risk of financial loss or reputational harm is a direct consequence of its use.\n\n- **Proximity:**\n  - **Analysis:** The relationship between Witch and Marcela includes several factors:\n    - **Reliance:** Marcela relied on Witch to provide safe and tested AR filters.\n    - **Control:** Witch exercised control over the creation and distribution of these filters.\n    - **Contractual Terms:** The terms stating Witch is \"not responsible for creators' content\" may limit its liability. However, this exclusion does not necessarily negate a duty of care, especially if the harm arises from Witch\u2019s development processes rather than content management.\n\n- **Policy Considerations:**\n  - Imposing a duty may constrain innovation, but this needs to be weighed against the necessity to protect creators from unchecked risks due to insufficient quality controls by the platform.\n\n### 2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n\n**Duty of Care to Viewers:**\n- **Factual Foreseeability:**\n  - **Analysis for Witch:** It was likely foreseeable that extreme, gory AR projections could cause severe distress to viewers like Khan, especially given the specific intent to create a \"scary\" experience.\n  - **Analysis for Marcela:** Marcela\u2019s promotional language (\"witness the true meaning of horror\") suggests an anticipation of an intense experience, yet the actual level of severity might not have been foreseen by her.\n\n- **Proximity:**\n  - **Witch's Role:**\n    - Control over the development of the filter and responsibility for ensuring it did not transmit harmful content places them in a potential proximity to the viewer.\n  - **Marcela's Role:**\n    - Marcela\u2019s relationship with her audience involves an implicit agreement for entertainment, and while she warned viewers, the expectation of reasonable safety remains.\n\n- **Policy Considerations:**\n  - Policy considerations involve a balance between content freedom and viewer harm. For creators, overly strict liabilities may deter content creation, but platforms like Witch must exercise responsibility for hazardous tools they create.\n\n### 3. Other than negligence, are there any other torts Khan may use to sue Witch and/or Marcela?\n\n- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED):**\n  - **Elements:** Conduct must be outrageous and must cause severe emotional distress. This hinges on showing that Witch and/or Marcela acted with reckless disregard to cause harm. Given the content\u2019s unexpectedly severe nature, IIED claims could potentially be valid against Witch, especially if their use of explicit training data is proven reckless.\n\n- **Product Liability:**\n  - If the AR filter is viewed as a product, Khan may argue that it is defective, particularly as it was broadcast without proper quality assurance. This could lead to claims under Singapore\u2019s product liability frameworks, focusing on product safety and defectiveness.\n\n- **Defamation:**\n  - Unlikely applicable, as Khan\u2019s claim is based on personal distress with no apparent defamatory statement damaging his reputation.\n\nThe application of these legal principles requires a detailed analysis of contractual terms, the foreseeability of harms, relationship proximities, and the broader implications of imposing duties on digital platforms and creators. The unique overlap of technology and tort law necessitates nuanced judicial consideration, particularly in the context of emerging digital content and platform responsibilities.",
          "analysis": "To analyze the legal questions in this hypothetical scenario, we must adopt the Spandeck framework, focusing on duty of care as established under Singapore law.\n\n### 1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\n**Duty of Care Framework:**\n- **Factual Foreseeability:**\n  - **Analysis:** It must be assessed whether Witch could reasonably foresee that deploying an inadequately tested AR filter could harm content creators such as Marcela. The potential for substantial financial loss and reputational harm was foreseeable given the distressing nature of the AR content and the lack of quality assurance.\n\n- **Proximity:**\n  - **Analysis:** The relationship dynamics between Witch and Marcela suggest proximity in various facets:\n    - **Reliance:** Marcela's reliance on Witch for providing safe filters is evident.\n    - **Control:** Witch\u2019s creation and deployment of the filters entail control over potential outcomes.\n    - **Contractual Terms:** While Witch's Terms of Use disclaim responsibility for creators\u2019 content, this cannot preclude liability arising from Witch's own procedural failings, particularly in developing potentially harmful AR filters.\n\n- **Policy Considerations:**\n  - Imposing a duty of care might constrain the platform's innovation potential. However, safeguarding creators from foreseeable harm due to Witch's negligent deployment processes supports finding a duty of care.\n\n### 2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n\n**Duty of Care to Viewers:**\n- **Factual Foreseeability:**\n  - **Analysis for Witch:** The gruesome AR projections were foreseeably distressing, making it plausible that a reasonable person would predict potential psychiatric harm to viewers, like Khan, affecting foreseeability.\n  - **Analysis for Marcela:** While foreseeing some level of fright was likely, the severity of distress likely fell outside her anticipation, although she promoted an intense experience.\n\n- **Proximity:**\n  - **Witch's Role:** Witch had direct control over the filter's content and distribution, indicating a proximity sufficient to impose a duty.\n  - **Marcela's Role:** Marcela\u2019s relationship with viewers suggests an expectation for reasonable safety, notwithstanding her disclaimer. Close contact through streaming and the targeted nature of audience engagement strengthens the argument for proximity.\n\n- **Policy Considerations:**\n  - While creators\u2019 content freedom must be preserved, a balance must be struck with viewer protection from foreseeable harm. Witch, primarily, as the platform operator, bears a heightened responsibility for product oversight.\n\n### 3. Other than negligence, are there any other torts Khan may use to sue Witch and/or Marcela?\n\n- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED):**\n  - **Elements:** Considering Witch's reckless use of explicit training data to generate AR content, a claim for IIED could be viable against Witch due to the reckless disregard for potential harm.\n\n- **Product Liability:**\n  - Khan may pursue a claim based on product liability, arguing that the defectively distributed AR filter amounted to an unreasonably dangerous product per Singapore\u2019s product safety regulations.\n\n- **Defamation:**\n  - This tort remains unlikely, as Khan's injury relates to psychiatric harm rather than reputational damage.\n\n### Conclusion\nApplying Singapore's legal principles under the Spandeck framework, Witch is likely found to owe a duty of care to Marcela, primarily due to foreseeable harm and a proximate relationship. Likewise, Witch and, to a lesser extent, Marcela could owe a duty to Khan, given the potential foreseeable harm and relational proximity. The application of these principles requires careful judicial consideration of technological implications on tortious liability within content-streaming platforms.",
          "conclusion": "To adequately address the legal questions in this hypothetical scenario involving Witch, Marcela, and Khan, we will employ the Spandeck framework, focusing on the duty of care as articulated under Singaporean tort law. This analysis will cover each posed question distinctly:\n\n### 1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n\n**Duty of Care Framework:**\n\n- **Factual Foreseeability:**\n  - **Analysis:** Witch could reasonably foresee the risk of harm to content creators like Marcela from deploying an inadequately tested AR filter. The severe financial losses and reputational harm that Marcela experienced were foreseeable outcomes given the failure to conduct quality assurance, particularly when dealing with AR filters meant to produce hyper-realistic and unsettling images.\n\n- **Proximity:**\n  - **Analysis:** The relationship between Witch and Marcela demonstrates proximity:\n    - **Reliance:** Marcela depended on Witch to ensure that any AR filters provided for streaming were safe to use.\n    - **Control:** Witch exercised control over the development and distribution of AR filters, which implicates them in the potential harm caused.\n    - **Contractual Terms:** Although Witch's Terms of Use deny responsibility for user-created content, this does not exempt them from liability for harm arising from defects in the AR filters they produce and distribute.\n\n- **Policy Considerations:**\n  - While imposing a duty might constrain innovation, there is a compelling need to protect creators from preventable harm due to Witch's negligence in filter deployment. This balance tends towards acknowledging the existence of a duty of care owed by Witch to its content creators like Marcela.\n\n### 2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n\n**Duty of Care to Viewers:**\n\n- **Factual Foreseeability:**\n  - **Analysis for Witch:** Witch\u2019s use of explicit and potentially distressing training data for AR filters made the likelihood of causing psychiatric harm to viewers like Khan foreseeable. A reasonable person would predict such an outcome from broadcasting gory and hyper-realistic images.\n  - **Analysis for Marcela:** While Marcela anticipated some fright among viewers, the extremity of distress was likely unforeseen by her, despite the promotion of an intense experience.\n\n- **Proximity:**\n  - **Witch's Role:** Witch had substantial control over the AR filter's development and distribution, thereby establishing sufficient proximity to impose a duty of care towards viewers like Khan.\n  - **Marcela's Role:** Although Marcela issued a disclaimer about the content being intense, the streamer-viewer relationship inherently encompasses a degree of duty to ensure basic safety, which provides proximity, albeit weaker than for Witch.\n\n- **Policy Considerations:**\n  - Balancing viewer protection against content creators' freedom is crucial. Witch\u2019s role as a platform operator means they have a significant responsibility for oversight and ensuring that content does not cross certain harm thresholds.\n\n### 3. Other than negligence, are there any other torts Khan may use to sue Witch and/or Marcela?\n\n- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED):**\n  - **Elements:** A claim for IIED could be viable against Witch, given the use of explicit training data reflecting reckless disregard for potential harm. The deliberate choice to use material capable of producing graphic content could be construed as reckless conduct warranting such a claim.\n\n- **Product Liability:**\n  - Khan might argue that the AR filter constitutes a defective product under Singapore\u2019s product liability regime. Deploying it without adequate quality checks or assurances renders it dangerously defective, justifying a claim under product liability frameworks.\n\n- **Defamation:**\n  - This claim is unlikely as the harm caused was psychiatric, without the element of reputational damage that defamation requires.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nApplying the Spandeck framework, Witch is likely to owe a duty of care to both Marcela and viewers like Khan. This arises from the foreseeability of the harm and the proximity inherent in the respective relationships. Marcela may also bear some responsibility to Khan, though to a lesser extent, primarily linked to her role in streaming the content. This analysis underscores the complexities at the intersection of emerging technology and tort law, indicating a need for judicial scrutiny to establish precedent for such scenarios."

          "issues": "To address the legal questions posed in the hypothetical scenario involving Marcela and the \"Witch\" platform, we need to explore the potential liabilities and duties of care owed by the parties involved. Here's an analysis of the key legal issues at stake:\n\n1. **Duty of care owed by Witch to Marcela:**\n\n   - **Existence of a Duty of Care:** The core issue is whether Witch, as the platform provider, owed Marcela a duty of care. A duty of care in negligence arises when there is a relationship that requires one party to take reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable harm to another. Here, the platform has a contractual relationship with Marcela, governed by the Terms of Use, which explicitly disclaims responsibility for content. However, the development and provision of the AR filter might generate a separate duty of care if it can be argued that Witch's actions (or inactions, such as failing to ensure quality assurance) created a foreseeable risk of harm to Marcela's business interests.\n\n   - **Scope of Duty:** The scope would likely cover foreseeable harm, such as the emotional distress and loss of subscribers that Marcela suffered. Witch's failure to conduct quality assurance on the AR filter could be considered a breach of this duty if it involved a risk that could be reasonably foreseen to cause harm to creators.\n\n2. **Duty of care owed to Khan by Witch or Marcela:**\n\n   - **Duty of Care by Witch:** Given that Witch is the platform provider that created and implemented the new AR filter, there is potential for a duty of care owed to viewers like Khan. The duty might arise from Witch's conduct in providing the unsafe filter, and therefore, whether they should have reasonably foreseen harm, such as psychiatric injury, resulting from the broadcast of gruesome images.\n\n   - **Duty of Care by Marcela:** As the content creator actively using the filter, the question is whether Marcela owed a duty of care to her viewers, including Khan. Applying general principles, Marcela might have foreseen that hyper-realistic, gruesome content could cause distress. However, the standard of care might take into account the nature of the content typically streamed and the expected audience, particularly since the \"horror\" theme was standard for her streams.\n\n3. **Other tort claims Khan may pursue:**\n\n   - **Infliction of Emotional Distress:**\n     - **Intentional Infliction:** This tort requires conduct that is extreme and outrageous, intentionally or recklessly inflicted to cause emotional distress. The facts do not suggest intentional or reckless conduct by either Witch or Marcela.\n     - **Negligent Infliction:** Khan might have a claim if it can be shown that the conduct was negligent (i.e., Marcela or Witch failed to exercise due care in the circumstances, leading to his psychiatric injury).\n\n   - **Possible Misrepresentation:**\n     - If Khan relied on representations by Marcela about the nature of the content, which turned out to be misleading due to Witch's AR filter, this may give rise to a claim of negligent misrepresentation, provided all elements of the tort are satisfied.\n\nThis legal analysis focused on duty of care and other potential tort liabilities. The complex interaction between platforms and content creators, coupled with legal standards governing such relationships, underpin the exploration of these issues. As legal outcomes can be very fact-specific, more detailed facts about the operational and contractual dynamics between Witch, Marcela, and their obligations to users would further refine these conclusions.",
          "rules": "To analyze the legal issues presented in the hypothetical scenario involving Marcela and the \"Witch\" platform, we need to break down the problem into specific legal questions and assess them against the applicable Australian legal frameworks for negligence and tort law:\n\n1. **Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?**\n\n   - **Existence of a Duty of Care:** In Australian tort law, a duty of care arises when the relationship between the parties suggests one party should reasonably foresee harm to the other. Under the principles laid out in cases like *Donoghue v Stevenson* and the discussion surrounding proximity and foreseeability, Marcela has a reasonable expectation that Witch would ensure the safety and quality of its AR filters. Witch\u2019s failure to conduct a proper quality assurance due to oversight may establish such duty, as Marcela relied on the platform for her livelihood.\n\n   - **Contractual Considerations:** The Terms of Use explicitly disclaim responsibility for content, which can limit Witch\u2019s duty. However, if Witch\u2019s actions directly created a risk (e.g., untested filters), there could still be an affirmative duty independent of the contractual disclaimer. The disclaimer could be scrutinized for whether it is valid and enforceable under Australian law, particularly if it attempts to exclude liability for negligence, which generally requires clarity and forewarning.\n\n2. **Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?**\n\n   - **Duty of Care by Witch:** The platform's role in deploying the filter and engineering the software without quality assurance implicates a breach of duty. Under the *Annetts* case criteria for negligent psychiatric harm, Witch should have reasonably foreseen that broadcasting such content would likely cause distress and constitutes a breach of care to viewers who expect a certain standard influenced by the platform.\n\n   - **Duty of Care by Marcela:** While Marcela's usual content is horror-themed, the unexpected nature of the broadcast goes beyond reasonable viewer expectations. She could owe a duty if foreseeably turning on such realistic content would cause psychiatric injury, especially given the distinct horror label may not necessarily imply the traumatic level encountered with the filter\u2019s malfunction. Still, given the thematic alignment, the required duty may have been inadvertently overridden by expectations associated with her content style, which her audience voluntarily subscribes to.\n\n3. **Other than negligence, are there any other tort(s) which Khan may use to sue Witch and/or Marcela?**\n\n   - **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress:** Khan might argue Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress if he can show Witch and Marcela breached their duty through negligence, causing him psychiatric injury. Following the formulation in *Tame v New South Wales*, foreseeability of harm and the connection between the conduct and the injury will be pivotal.\n\n   - **Misrepresentation:** If it can be shown Marcela, relying on Witch's assurances, falsely marketed the stream as merely spooky rather than terrifying, there may be a negligent misrepresentation claim. This would require establishing that the representation was made to Khan's reliance and that it was reasonable for Khan to draw conclusions reviewed in cases such as *Shaddock v Parramatta City Council (No 1)*.\n\nThe legal landscape as defined by duties of care centers on the foreseeability, closeness of relationship, and reliance or expectation of safe conduct in creating or displaying content that public interacts with, as well as inherent liability limitations noted in disclaimers. While the platform and creator both have defenses, the actions straddling or contravening reasonable conduct may attract liability under Australian tort law, albeit heavily dependent on the nuances of each situation's context and provided purpose.",
          "analysis": "To address the hypothetical scenario involving Marcela and the \"Witch\" platform, it's essential to evaluate the potential liabilities and duties of care concerning Australian tort law. The analysis focuses on duties owed by Witch to Marcela, as well as duties owed by Witch and Marcela to Khan. Additionally, alternative tort claims applicable to Khan's situation are explored.\n\n### 1. Duty of care owed by Witch to Marcela\n\n#### Existence of a Duty of Care:\nIn assessing whether Witch owes Marcela a duty of care, the principles from seminal cases such as *Donoghue v Stevenson* need to be considered. The essence of a duty of care under Australian negligence law involves the foreseeability of harm, a close relationship between the parties, and proportionality or reasonableness of imposing such a duty.\n\n- **Foreseeability and Proximity:** Marcela relies economically on Witch's platform and has entrusted her streams and business interests to it. Witch\u2019s failure to ensure the safety and quality of AR filters, thus affecting Marcela\u2019s streams detrimentally, could establish a duty of care, given the foreseeable risk of such failure leading to economic losses and reputation damages.\n  \n- **Contractual Disclaimers:** The platform's Terms of Use disclaim responsibility for content. While disclaimers can limit liability, they cannot entirely absolve it, especially if the provider itself contributes to the risk (here, through the provision of faulty AR filters). The enforceability of such disclaimers under Australian law, particularly concerning clauses excluding liability for negligence, usually necessitates clear and unambiguous wording. The context and visibility of the disclaimer also play critical roles in its enforceability.\n\n### 2. Duty of care owed to Khan by Witch or Marcela\n\n#### Duty of Care by Witch:\n- **Psychiatric Injury in Negligence:** In the *Annetts* case regarding psychiatric harm, clear factors are considered such as foreseeability, the nature of the injury, and the relationship between parties. Witch should arguably have foreseen that release of gruesome and hyper-realistic content without proper quality assurance could cause distress among viewers, particularly when broadcast in a format purporting to provide entertainment. This places a duty on Witch to prevent psychogenic injuries like those suffered by Khan.\n\n#### Duty of Care by Marcela:\n- **Content Creator Responsibility:** While Marcela\u2019s content is of a horror theme, the extent of graphic content aired transcended accepted norms, which might establish a liability if she could foresee that using the filter without prior verification would cause such extreme distress. However, given her thematic alignment with horror themes, the expectation of viewers experiencing fright is inherent, which complicates arguments of breached duty.\n\n### 3. Other tort claims Khan may pursue:\n\n#### Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress:\n- **Causation and Breach:** Khan might argue for negligent infliction of emotional distress by showing that either, or both, Witch and Marcela failed to reasonably prevent the harm. This requires demonstrating the conduct was negligent, causing his psychiatric injury, under circumstances where such distress was foreseeable, as outlined in *Tame v New South Wales*.\n\n#### Misrepresentation:\n- **Marketing and Assurances:** If Marcela, influenced by Witch's assurances, misrepresented the nature of content thereby leading viewers, including Khan, to a different expectation, it could form the basis for a negligent misrepresentation claim. Elements would include reliance on the representation and a mismatch between promised and delivered experience, supported by comparable case law such as *Shaddock v Parramatta City Council (No 1)*.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWitch's potential duty to Marcela invocates principles of foreseeability and duty due to reliance on platform-operating procedures. Concerning Khan, duties stemming from negligence principles focus on psychiatric injury liabilities, given the unexpected content extremity. Alternative tort claims like negligent infliction of emotional distress and misrepresentation provide avenues for assessable legal recourse for Khan and establish a complex legal landscape influenced by the particulars of each duty, the reliance created, and the injury sustained. Further inquiry could elaborate on the practical enforceability of platform disclaimers and the heightened responsibility of content creators within transformative digital spaces.",
          "conclusion": "In analyzing the hypothetical scenario involving Marcela and the \"Witch\" platform, we need to address three distinct legal questions under Australian tort law: whether Witch owes Marcela a duty of care, whether Witch and/or Marcela owe a duty of care to Khan, and whether there are other torts Khan could pursue besides negligence.\n\n### 1. Duty of Care Owed by Witch to Marcela\n\n**Existence of a Duty of Care:**\nThe leading case of *Donoghue v Stevenson* establishes that a duty of care arises where harm is foreseeable, the parties are in a proximate relationship, and it is reasonable to impose such a duty. In this context, Witch may owe Marcela a duty of care because:\n\n- **Foreseeability:** Witch provided a platform and tools that directly affect Marcela's content. The failure to conduct quality assurance poses a foreseeable risk of harm to Marcela\u2019s business undertakings, particularly given her reliance on the platform for her economic activities.\n  \n- **Proximity and Reliance:** Marcela depends on Witch for the platform\u2019s functionalities to run her business. There is a close and direct business relationship wherein Marcela relies on Witch to ensure the quality of its AR filters.\n\n**Contractual Disclaimers:**\nWhile Witch's Terms of Use disclaim liability for content, the question is whether this disclaimer effectively negates a duty of care regarding the technical failures of software developed by Witch itself. In Australian law, disclaimers excluding liability for negligence must be clear and sufficiently brought to the attention of the other party. Therefore, the effectiveness of such a disclaimer may be scrutinized, particularly if Witch\u2019s actions fall outside the scope of merely providing a platform.\n\n### 2. Duty of Care Owed to Khan by Witch or Marcela\n\n**Duty of Care by Witch:**\nUnder the principles elucidated in psychiatric injury cases such as *Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd*, Witch should have foreseen that the deployment of untested filters resulting in broadcasting severe images could cause emotional distress among viewers. Therefore, Witch arguably has a duty to prevent such psychogenic injuries.\n\n**Duty of Care by Marcela:**\nMarcela, as a content creator, also has a duty to her audience. Despite the horror theme aligning with her usual content, the unexpected extremity of the images might exceed anticipations. If it could be shown that Marcela should have anticipated potential harm by using an untested filter, a duty may exist. However, the voluntary nature of viewership and its inherent expectation of fright complicate this.\n\n### 3. Other Tort Claims Khan May Pursue\n\n**Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress:**\nKhan could argue a case of negligent infliction of emotional distress, needing to demonstrate that Witch and/or Marcela\u2019s conduct was negligent, foreseeably leading to his psychiatric injury. The connection between the conduct and the injury claimed would be central under the ruling in *Tame v New South Wales*.\n\n**Misrepresentation:**\nIf Marcela made representations about the nature of the broadcasting content\u2014relying on assurances by Witch about the filters\u2014Khan may claim negligent misrepresentation. This requires a demonstration of reliance on such representations and a disparity between what was represented and what was exhibited, as seen in *Shaddock v Parramatta City Council (No 1)*.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWitch potentially owes a duty of care to Marcela due to foreseeable economic reliance and an incomplete disclaimer process concerning negligence. Regarding Khan, both Witch and Marcela might owe a duty of care for psychiatric injury, dependent on the scope of foreseen consequences of their actions. Besides negligence, Khan might pursue claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress and misrepresentation, contingent on establishing the required elements under each tort. The interaction between disclaimers, foreseeability, and the responsibilities of digital content providers presents nuanced questions of liability within current Australian legal context. Further factual clarity, especially around the nature of platform disclaimers, could impact the legal positioning of both parties significantly."

The\nplatform was founded 6 years ago and is based in Singapore. Its main selling point is a\nrange of AR \ufb01lters called \u2014 \u201cperspectives\u201d or \u201cpaxes\u201d by the community \u2014 which let\nstreamers superimpose hyper-realistic 3D graphics over real world video. These can be\nactivated at the click of a button, and streamers generally do not concern themselves with\nhow they work.\nThe platform rose to fame because of its dedication towards helping its creators make con-\ntent (and money) \u201clike magic\u201d. Since the beginning, Witch maintained a \u201ccreator \ufb01rst\u201d\npolicy which very publicly declares that all subscription fees \u201cgo directly in the \ufb01rst in-\nstance to our content creators; we only take a modest amount to keep the platform run-\nning\u201d. This modest amount is 10% of the subscription fee viewers pay. Creators alone\ndecide how much to set these fees at. In this regard, Witch differs from usual platforms\nwhere, in those other platforms, (1) viewer money goes \ufb01rst to the platform which takes\na cut before disbursing funds to the streamer\u2019s account, (2) average platform fees range\nbetween 20\u201330%; and (3) creators are required to charge an amount the platform sets.\nThe relationship between Witch and its creators is shaped by Witch\u2019s Terms of Use which\nbinds both creators and viewers alike. The Terms state that Witch is \u201cnot responsible for\nany content our creators publish on our platform\u201d. Nothing else in the Terms is material.\nAs for Marcela, her success really began in October last year, when she decided to do\na Halloween special. She streamed herself taking a walk through Bishan-Ang Mo Kio\npark at night while using one of Witch\u2019s \u201chorror\u201d paxes to make it seem as if every other\nhuman in the park was some kind of nightly horror \u2014 zombies, werewolves, giants, beasts,\nvampires, and ghosts galore. That stream attracted 50,000 active viewers.\nBut all that was last year. Since then, Marcela has organised her channel around horror\nstreams: night visits to the abandoned Old Changi Hospital, mysterious spots in Pulau\nUbin, etc, all of them enhanced by Witch\u2019s paxes. This has won her dedicated subscriber\nbase amongst Singapore teens aged 14\u201320, who enjoy watching her streams with friends\nat sleepovers and the like.\n AY2022/23-I\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n3\nCapitalising on her success, on 12 August 2022 Marcela planned a huge \u201cSeventh Month\nSpecial\u201d. This coincided with the \ufb01rst day of the Lunar seventh month, a date broadly\nunderstood in Chinese superstition as the day the gates of the Underworld open, allowing\nits denizens to roam the world of the living. Marcela asked Witch if they could make her\na \u201cspecial, extra scary Seventh Month pax which shows extremely realistic ghosts \ufb02ying\neverywhere, so that my subscribers get the fright of their lives\u201d. Witch readily agreed, as it\nwas raring to try out a new AR generation software its engineers had just \ufb01nished building.\nMarcela marketed the event aggressively on her channel, asking her viewers to \u201cinvite all\nyour friends and non-believers to come and witness the true meaning of horror (at your\nown risk!)\u201d.\nMarcela then set herself up on 11 August 2022, 2300 hours, in the middle of Lim Chu\nKang cemetery. Together with her viewers, she counted down to midnight. By 2355\nhours, her stream had upwards of 250,000 viewers (not including those watching through\ntheir friends\u2019 accounts). Once the clock struck twelve, Marcela turned the new pax on.\nWhat transpired was truly the meaning of horror. It turned out that Witch\u2019s engineers had\nbuilt the new software by training a machine learning algorithm on particularly gruesome\nand grisly images \u2014 the sort that would be banned outright from television. This included\nreal images of dead, dismembered, and decaying humans and other (previously) living\nthings. That was how they were able to replicate hyper-realistic, and utterly frightful AR\nvisions. Witch did not realise that paxes created by this software had the potential to repro-\nduce the exact same images on their platform (in hyper-realistic 3D no less). Because of a\ncareless oversight on Witch\u2019s part, the new software did not go through quality assurance\nor censorship before deployment.\nThe moment the \ufb01lter was enabled, gory images in the software\u2019s training data were in-\nstantly broadcast to all of Marcela\u2019s viewers, in\ufb02icting severe distress and emotional dam-\nage. As she was busy \ufb01lming, Marcela did not realise what was happening until a sharp\nfall in viewer count minutes into the stream prompted her to check what they were seeing.\nShe immediately turned the \ufb01lter off when she did.\nBy then, however, the damage had been done. Marcela went from expecting 10,000 new\nsubscribers from that event to losing 250,000 subscribers overnight.\nThis causes her\nmonthly subscriber revenue to plunge by $250,000, as she charges $1/month. She also\n \nAnswer all the following questions using only material covered up till and not includ-\ning the Standard of Care. You also need not discuss anything to do with defences.\n1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?\n2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?\n3. Other than negligence, are there any other tort(s) which Khan may use to sue Witch\nand/or Marcela? Brie\ufb02y explain.\nMake sure that your answer to each sub-question is clearly demarcated. If more facts\nare needed for your analysis, state them and explain why.\n AY2022/23-I\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n4\nhad to cancel planned specials for the rest of the Seventh Month. These, she estimates,\nwould have net her another 25,000 new subscribers. To make things worse, two months\nlater she gets a lawyer\u2019s letter from Khan, who had developed a recognised psychiatric\ninjury from watching her stream. Though she is completely \ufb01ne herself, Marcela suspects\nthat many other viewers could have come down with such psychiatric injuries as well.\n* * *\nAnswer all the following questions using only material covered up till and not includ-\ning the Standard of Care.

          "issues": "### Key Legal Issues in the Hypothetical Scenario:\n\n#### **1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?**  \n**Legal Issue:** Whether Witch, as the operator of the AR streaming platform, owes Marcela (a content creator) a duty of care under Singapore tort law, particularly in relation to the negligent deployment of a defective AR filter (\"pax\") that caused her financial and reputational harm.  \n\n**Analysis:**  \n- **Threshold of Factual Foreseeability (Spandeck Test):** Witch should have foreseen that deploying an untested, hyper-realistic horror filter (trained on gruesome images) without quality assurance could cause harm to creators like Marcela, especially given its \"creator-first\" policy and reliance on its platform for revenue.  \n- **Proximity:** There is a close relationship between Witch and Marcela as a platform and content creator, governed by contractual Terms of Use. Witch\u2019s direct involvement in creating the defective pax (at Marcela\u2019s request) strengthens proximity.  \n- **Policy Considerations:** No clear policy reasons negate the duty (e.g., floodgates risk is minimal, as this involves a specific platform-creator relationship).  \n\n**Conclusion:** Witch likely owes Marcela a duty of care for economic losses (lost subscribers) due to its negligent act.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?**  \n**Legal Issue:** Whether Witch or Marcela owes Khan (a viewer who suffered psychiatric injury) a duty of care for negligently broadcasting distressing content.  \n\n**Analysis:**  \n- **Foreseeability:** Both parties should have foreseen that hyper-realistic, gory content could cause psychiatric harm, especially to a young audience (teens aged 14\u201320). Marcela\u2019s marketing (\"at your own risk!\") and Witch\u2019s knowledge of the pax\u2019s content support this.  \n- **Proximity:**  \n  - **Witch:** As the platform hosting the stream, Witch had control over the pax\u2019s deployment. Its failure to censor or test the filter creates proximity to viewers.  \n  - **Marcela:** She curated the horror-themed content and encouraged viewership, creating a relationship with her audience.  \n- **Policy:** While courts are cautious about psychiatric injury claims (per *Alcock*), Khan\u2019s injury (diagnosed PTSD) is arguably foreseeable and not too remote.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Both Witch and Marcela may owe Khan a duty of care, subject to proving breach and causation.  \n\n---\n\n#### **3.

Duty of Care Owed by Witch to Marcela**  \n**Legal Framework:**  \nThe *Spandeck* test (*Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science & Technology Agency* [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100) governs the duty of care in negligence.  \n\n**Application:**  \n- **Factual Foreseeability:** Witch, as the developer and distributor of the AR filter, ought to have foreseen that deploying an untested, hyper-realistic horror filter (trained on gruesome images) could cause financial harm to Marcela, whose livelihood depended on the platform. The direct loss of 250,000 subscribers ($250,000 in revenue) is a foreseeable consequence of such negligence.  \n- **Proximity:**  \n  - **Contractual Relationship:** Witch\u2019s \"creator-first\" policy and direct collaboration with Marcela in developing the \"Seventh Month pax\" establish a close relationship.  \n  - **Control:** Witch exclusively controlled the pax\u2019s deployment and failed to conduct quality assurance, despite knowing its potential impact.  \n- **Policy Considerations:** No policy reasons (e.g., floodgates) negate the duty, given the specific commercial context.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWitch owes Marcela a duty of care for economic losses arising from the defective pax.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2.

Alternative Torts Available to Khan**  \n**Potential Claims:**  \n1. **Wilkinson v Downton (Intentional Infliction of Harm):**  \n   - **Elements:** Reckless conduct causing psychiatric harm.  \n   - **Application:** Khan could argue Witch/Marcela acted recklessly by deploying the pax despite its known risks.  \n   - **Challenge:** Requires proof of intent or reckless disregard (may be difficult absent evidence of prior knowledge).  \n\n2. **Occupiers\u2019 Liability Act (Cap 314):**  \n   - **Application:** If the stream occurred in a physical location (Lim Chu Kang cemetery), Marcela might owe a duty to ensure viewer safety.  \n   - **Limitation:** The harm stemmed from digital content, not physical premises.  \n\n3. **Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Act:**  \n   - **Application:** If the pax is deemed a \"product,\" Witch could face liability for distributing a defective item.  \n   - **Limitation:** Unclear if AR filters qualify as \"products.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Wilkinson v Downton* is the most viable alternative, but negligence remains the stronger claim.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Additional Facts Required**  \n1. **For Q1:** Whether Witch\u2019s Terms of Use exclude liability for its own negligence.  \n2. **For Q2:** Medical evidence confirming Khan\u2019s PTSD meets the threshold for psychiatric injury.  \n3. **For Q3:** Evidence of Witch/Marcela\u2019s actual knowledge of the pax\u2019s potential to cause harm (to support intentional torts).  \n\n### **Final Synthesis**  \nThe analysis confirms that:  \n1. Witch owes Marcela a duty of care for economic losses.  \n2. Both Witch and Marcela owe Khan a duty of care for psychiatric injury.  \n3. *Wilkinson v Downton* is a plausible alternative, though negligence is more straightforward.  \n\nThis conclusion aligns with Singapore\u2019s *Spandeck* framework and tort principles, focusing strictly on duty of care as instructed."

Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?**  \n\n**Legal Issues:**  \n- **Negligence & Duty of Care:** To establish negligence, Marcela must show that Witch owed her a duty of care. Under Australian law, a duty of care arises where:  \n  - The harm was reasonably foreseeable (*Donoghue v Stevenson*).  \n  - There is sufficient proximity between the parties (*Sullivan v Moody*).  \n  - It is fair, just, and reasonable to impose such a duty (*Caparo v Dickman*).  \n\n**Application:**  \n- **Foreseeability:** Witch knew Marcela was a high-profile streamer relying on their AR filters for content. The risk of psychological harm from hyper-realistic horror imagery was foreseeable, especially given the intended \"extra scary\" filter.  \n- **Proximity:** Witch had a direct contractual and operational relationship with Marcela as a content creator. Their \"creator-first\" policy suggests a close working relationship.  \n- **Fairness & Policy:** Imposing a duty is reasonable given Witch\u2019s control over the AR software and its failure to conduct quality assurance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nYes, Witch likely owes Marcela a duty of care in negligence for failing to ensure the AR filter was safe for use.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?**  \n\n**Legal Issues:**  \n- **Psychiatric Injury (Nervous Shock):** For Khan to claim, he must show:  \n  - He suffered a **recognised psychiatric illness** (not mere distress).  \n  - The harm was **reasonably foreseeable** (*Tame v NSW*).  \n  - He was in a **close relationship** with the victim (if applicable) or directly affected (*Annetts v Australian Stations*).  \n\n**Application:**  \n- **Witch\u2019s Duty to Khan:**  \n  - **Foreseeability:** The extreme distress caused by hyper-realistic gore was foreseeable, especially given the advertised \"true meaning of horror.\"  \n  - **Proximity:** Witch had control over the AR filter and knew it would be broadcast to a large audience.  \n  - **Fairness:** Witch\u2019s failure to test the filter supports imposing a duty.  \n\n- **Marcela\u2019s Duty to Khan:**  \n  - **Foreseeability:** She marketed the event as \"extra scary\" and warned viewers of risks, suggesting awareness of potential harm.  \n  - **Proximity:** As the streamer, she had a direct relationship with her audience.  \n  - **Fairness:** While she did not create the filter, she chose to use it without verifying its safety.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBoth Witch and Marcela likely owe Khan a duty of care for psychiatric injury.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **3. Other than negligence, are there any other torts Khan may use to sue Witch and/or Marcela?**  \n\n**Potential Torts:**  \n1. **Breach of Statutory Duty (if applicable):**  \n   - If Singaporean/Australian law imposes safety obligations on AR platforms, Witch may be liable for failing to comply.  \n\n2. **Defamation (if applicable):**  \n   - If the broadcast contained false and damaging representations (e.g., implying real violence), but this is unlikely as the images were fictional.  \n\n3. **Occupiers\u2019 Liability (if applicable):**  \n   - If Witch is considered an \"occupier\" of the virtual space, they may owe a duty to ensure safety (*Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic)*, but this is a novel argument.  \n\n4. **Product Liability (if applicable):**  \n   - If the AR filter is classified as a \"product,\" Witch could be liable under consumer protection laws for supplying a defective product causing harm.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNegligence is the strongest claim, but **product liability** (if applicable) could also be argued.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Summary of Key Legal Issues**  \n1. **Witch owes Marcela a duty of care** in negligence for financial and reputational harm.  \n2. **Both Witch and Marcela owe Khan a duty of care** for psychiatric injury.  \n3. **Alternative torts:** Product liability (if AR filters are deemed \"products\") is the most viable secondary claim.  \n\nWould you like further elaboration on any specific issue?",
          "rules": "### **Detailed Legal Analysis of the Hypothetical Scenario**  \n\n#### **1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?**  \n\n**Applicable Legal Framework:**  \nUnder Australian tort law, the existence of a duty of care is determined by the **three-stage test** derived from *Caparo Industries plc v Dickman* [1990] 2 AC 605, as applied in cases like *Sullivan v Moody* (2001) 207 CLR 562:  \n1. **Foreseeability of Harm:** Whether a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would foresee the risk of harm to the plaintiff.  \n2. **Proximity:** Whether the relationship between the parties is sufficiently close to impose a duty.  \n3. **Fairness, Justice, and Reasonableness:** Whether imposing a duty is consistent with policy and legal principles.  \n\n**Application to Witch and Marcela:**  \n- **Foreseeability:** Witch knew Marcela was a professional streamer relying on their AR filters for content. The risk of reputational and financial harm from a defective filter (e.g., due to untested hyper-realistic imagery) was foreseeable, particularly given the \"extra scary\" nature of the requested filter.  \n- **Proximity:** The contractual relationship under Witch\u2019s Terms of Use and the \"creator-first\" policy indicate a direct and close relationship. Witch exercised control over the filter\u2019s design and deployment.  \n- **Fairness/Policy:** Imposing a duty aligns with Witch\u2019s role as a platform provider with technical control over the AR software. The lack of quality assurance (QA) testing supports the reasonableness of a duty.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nYes, Witch owes Marcela a duty of care in negligence for failing to ensure the AR filter was fit for purpose.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?**  \n\n**Applicable Legal Framework:**  \nFor psychiatric injury (\"nervous shock\"), the duty of care requires:  \n1. **Recognised Psychiatric Illness:** Khan must prove a diagnosable condition (*Tame v NSW* (2002) 211 CLR 317).  \n2. **Foreseeability:** The risk of psychiatric harm must be foreseeable to a person of ordinary fortitude (*Annetts v Australian Stations* (2002) 211 CLR 317).  \n3. **Proximity:** The plaintiff must be closely and directly affected by the defendant\u2019s conduct (e.g., as a primary victim or bystander in a close relationship).  \n\n**Application:**  \n- **Witch\u2019s Duty to Khan:**  \n  - **Foreseeability:** The filter\u2019s use of banned, hyper-realistic gore made severe distress foreseeable, especially given the event\u2019s marketing (\"true meaning of horror\").  \n  - **Proximity:** Witch knew the filter would be broadcast to a large audience, creating a direct relationship with viewers.  \n  - **Fairness:** Witch\u2019s failure to conduct QA or censorship supports imposing a duty.  \n\n- **Marcela\u2019s Duty to Khan:**  \n  - **Foreseeability:** Marcela promoted the event as \"extra scary\" and warned viewers of risks, indicating awareness of potential harm.  \n  - **Proximity:** As the streamer, she had a direct relationship with her audience, akin to a performer-audience dynamic.  \n  - **Fairness:** While she did not create the filter, her decision to use it without verification may breach a duty to her viewers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBoth Witch and Marcela likely owe Khan a duty of care for psychiatric injury.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **3. Other Potential Torts for Khan\u2019s Claim**  \n\n**Potential Claims Beyond Negligence:**  \n1. **Product Liability (Australian Consumer Law, Sch 2 of the *Competition and Consumer Act 2010* (Cth)):**  \n   - If the AR filter is classified as a \"good\" or \"service,\" Witch may be liable for supplying a defective product causing harm (s 138).  \n   - **Novelty:** AR filters may not clearly fit traditional \"product\" definitions, but their functional role (like software) could support liability.  \n\n2. **Breach of Statutory Duty:**  \n   - If Singaporean/Australian laws impose safety standards on digital platforms (e.g., content moderation), Witch\u2019s failure to comply could ground liability.  \n\n3. **Occupiers\u2019 Liability (Limited Application):**  \n   - Witch\u2019s virtual platform might analogously be treated as \"premises\" under the *Wrongs Act 1958* (Vic), but this is untested.  \n\n4. **Defamation (Unlikely):**  \n   - The broadcast did not contain false statements about Khan, ruling out defamation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nProduct liability under consumer law is the most viable alternative claim, though negligence remains the strongest avenue.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Key Takeaways**  \n1. **Witch\u2019s Duty to Marcela:** Established due to foreseeability, proximity, and policy considerations.  \n2. **Duty to Khan:** Both Witch (as filter creator) and Marcela (as broadcaster) owe duties for psychiatric injury.  \n3. **Alternative Torts:** Product liability is the most plausible secondary claim, contingent on classifying AR filters as \"products.\"  \n\n**Areas for Further Clarification:**  \n- Whether AR filters qualify as \"products\" under consumer law.  \n- The applicability of Singaporean statutory duties (if any) to Witch\u2019s operations.  \n\nWould you like deeper analysis on any specific point?",
          "analysis": "### **Revised Legal Analysis of the Hypothetical Scenario**  \n\n#### **1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?**  \n\n**Refined Legal Framework:**  \nThe duty of care analysis in Australia is guided by the **multi-factorial approach** endorsed in *Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar* (2009) 75 NSWLR 649, which synthesises principles from *Caparo* and *Sullivan v Moody*. Key considerations include:  \n- **Control:** The defendant\u2019s control over the risk (*Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil* (2000) 205 CLR 254).  \n- **Vulnerability:** The plaintiff\u2019s inability to protect themselves (*Wooldridge v Sumner* [1963] 2 QB 43).  \n- **Reliance:** Whether the plaintiff relied on the defendant\u2019s expertise or assurances (*Voli v Inglewood Shire Council* (1963) 110 CLR 74).  \n\n**Application to Witch and Marcela:**  \n- **Control:** Witch exclusively controlled the AR filter\u2019s design and deployment, including the use of untested machine-learning algorithms.  \n- **Vulnerability:** Marcela had no technical means to verify the filter\u2019s safety, rendering her reliant on Witch\u2019s QA processes.  \n- **Reliance:** Witch\u2019s \"creator-first\" policy implicitly assured creators of platform safety, reinforcing Marcela\u2019s reliance.  \n\n**Novel Consideration:**  \nThe **Terms of Use** disclaimer (\"not responsible for any content\") may not negate a duty of care if it conflicts with statutory consumer guarantees under the *Australian Consumer Law* (ACL), particularly if the clause is unfair under s 23 of the ACL.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWitch owes Marcela a duty of care. The disclaimer does not absolve Witch given its superior control and Marcela\u2019s vulnerability.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?**  \n\n**Refined Legal Framework:**  \nFor psychiatric injury, *Wicks v State Rail Authority (NSW)* (2010) 241 CLR 60 clarifies that:  \n- **Primary Victims:** No need for sudden shock; gradual onset injury suffices if the risk was foreseeable.  \n- **Class of Plaintiffs:** Duty extends to those reasonably anticipated to be affected by the defendant\u2019s conduct (*King v Philcox* (2015) 255 CLR 304).  \n\n**Application:**  \n- **Witch\u2019s Duty to Khan:**  \n  - **Foreseeability:** The filter\u2019s use of banned gore (akin to *Giller v Procopets* [2008] VSCA 236) made severe distress foreseeable.  \n  - **Control:** Witch\u2019s unilateral deployment of untested software heightened its responsibility.  \n  - **Policy:** Imposing a duty aligns with *ACL* consumer protections for digital services (s 60).  \n\n- **Marcela\u2019s Duty to Khan:**  \n  - **Assumption of Responsibility:** By marketing the event as \"at your own risk,\" Marcela arguably assumed responsibility for viewer welfare (*Heywood v Wellers* [1976] QB 446).  \n  - **Knowledge:** Her failure to preview the filter (despite its \"extra scary\" nature) may breach a duty to mitigate foreseeable harm.  \n\n**Novel Consideration:**  \nThe **live broadcast context** intensifies foreseeability, as real-time dissemination amplifies harm (*ABC v Lenah Game Meats* (2001) 208 CLR 199).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBoth parties owe Khan a duty. Witch\u2019s duty arises from its creation of the risk; Marcela\u2019s from her role in disseminating it.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **3. Alternative Torts for Khan\u2019s Claim**  \n\n**Expanded Analysis:**  \n1. **Product Liability (ACL, s 138):**  \n   - **\"Goods\" vs. \"Services\":** AR filters may qualify as \"goods\" under s 2(1) of the ACL if deemed \"software\" (*ACCC v Valve Corp* (2016) 337 ALR 647).  \n   - **Defect:** The filter\u2019s unintended gore constitutes a \"safety defect\" (s 9(1)), as it deviated from consumer expectations of horror-themed content.  \n\n2. **Misleading Conduct (ACL, s 18):**  \n   - Witch\u2019s \"creator-first\" policy could mislead if it implied rigorous QA testing (*Google Inc v ACCC* (2013) 249 CLR 435).  \n\n3. **Occupiers\u2019 Liability (Analogous Application):**  \n   - Witch\u2019s platform might be treated as \"premises\" under *Wrongs Act 1958* (Vic) s 14B, given its control over virtual \"entry\" conditions (*Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra* (2009) 237 CLR 215).  \n\n**Excluded Torts:**  \n- **Defamation:** No false imputation about Khan.  \n- **Nuisance:** No interference with land or public rights.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Product liability** (ACL) is the strongest alternative, with **misleading conduct** as a secondary option.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Key Refinements**  \n1. **Duty to Marcela:** Strengthened by *ACL* consumer protections and Witch\u2019s control.  \n2. **Duty to Khan:** Expanded to include *ACL* obligations and Marcela\u2019s assumption of responsibility.  \n3. **Alternative Torts:** Product liability is now firmly grounded in *ACL* jurisprudence.  \n\n**Areas for Judicial Clarification:**  \n- Whether AR filters are \"goods\" under the ACL.  \n- The applicability of occupiers\u2019 liability to virtual spaces.  \n\nWould you like further elaboration on the *ACL* or psychiatric injury thresholds?",
          "conclusion": "### **Final Legal Analysis and Conclusions**  \n\n#### **1. Does Witch owe Marcela a duty of care?**  \n\n**Legal Principles:**  \nThe duty of care in negligence is determined by the **multi-factorial approach** (*Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar* (2009) 75 NSWLR 649), requiring:  \n- **Foreseeability:** Whether a reasonable person in Witch\u2019s position would foresee harm to Marcela from defective AR filters.  \n- **Proximity:** The closeness of the relationship between Witch and Marcela, including contractual and operational ties.  \n- **Policy:** Whether imposing a duty is fair, just, and reasonable (*Sullivan v Moody* (2001) 207 CLR 562).  \n\n**Application:**  \n- **Foreseeability:** Witch knew Marcela relied on its filters for professional streaming. The risk of reputational and financial harm from untested, hyper-realistic horror content was foreseeable.  \n- **Proximity:** The \"creator-first\" policy and contractual relationship established a direct nexus. Witch controlled the filter\u2019s design and deployment without Marcela\u2019s technical oversight.  \n- **Policy:** Imposing a duty aligns with consumer protection principles under the *Australian Consumer Law* (ACL). Witch\u2019s disclaimer in its Terms of Use may be ineffective if deemed unfair under ACL s 23.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Yes**, Witch owes Marcela a duty of care. Its control over the AR filter and Marcela\u2019s reliance on Witch\u2019s platform safety create a clear duty to ensure the filter was fit for purpose.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Do either Witch or Marcela owe Khan a duty of care?**  \n\n**Legal Principles:**  \nFor psychiatric injury (\"nervous shock\"), Khan must show:  \n1. A **recognised psychiatric illness** (*Tame v NSW* (2002) 211 CLR 317).  \n2. **Foreseeability** of harm to a person of ordinary fortitude (*Annetts v Australian Stations* (2002) 211 CLR 317).  \n3. **Proximity**, such as being a primary victim or closely affected bystander (*Wicks v State Rail Authority (NSW)* (2010) 241 CLR 60).  \n\n**Application:**  \n- **Witch\u2019s Duty to Khan:**  \n  - **Foreseeability:** The filter\u2019s use of banned, hyper-realistic gore made severe distress foreseeable, especially given its advertised \"true meaning of horror.\"  \n  - **Proximity:** Witch knew the filter would be broadcast to a large audience, creating a direct relationship with viewers.  \n  - **Policy:** Witch\u2019s failure to test the filter supports imposing a duty (*ACL* s 60).  \n\n- **Marcela\u2019s Duty to Khan:**  \n  - **Foreseeability:** Marcela marketed the event as \"extra scary\" and warned viewers of risks, indicating awareness of potential harm.  \n  - **Proximity:** As the streamer, she had a direct relationship with her audience, akin to a performer-audience dynamic.  \n  - **Policy:** While she did not create the filter, her choice to use it without verification may breach a duty to mitigate foreseeable harm.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Yes**, both Witch and Marcela owe Khan a duty of care. Witch as the creator of the harmful content, and Marcela as the broadcaster who failed to vet it.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **3. Other Torts Available to Khan**  \n\n**Potential Claims:**  \n1. **Product Liability (ACL, s 138):**  \n   - If AR filters are classified as \"goods,\" Witch may be liable for supplying a defective product causing harm (*ACCC v Valve Corp* (2016) 337 ALR 647). The filter\u2019s unintended gore could constitute a \"safety defect\" (ACL s 9(1)).  \n\n2. **Misleading Conduct (ACL, s 18):**  \n   - Witch\u2019s \"creator-first\" policy may mislead creators into believing filters are safe, despite lacking QA testing (*Google Inc v ACCC* (2013) 249 CLR 435).  \n\n3. **Occupiers\u2019 Liability (Novel Argument):**  \n   - Witch\u2019s virtual platform might analogously be treated as \"premises\" under *Wrongs Act 1958* (Vic) s 14B, given its control over user access (*Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra* (2009) 237 CLR 215).  \n\n**Excluded Torts:**  \n- **Defamation:** No false statements about Khan.  \n- **Nuisance:** No interference with land or public rights.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Product liability** under the ACL is the strongest alternative claim. **Misleading conduct** is secondary but less direct.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Final Summary**  \n1. **Witch owes Marcela a duty of care** for negligence due to its control over the AR filter and Marcela\u2019s reliance.  \n2. **Both Witch and Marcela owe Khan a duty** for psychiatric injury, given foreseeability and proximity.  \n3. **Alternative torts:** Product liability (ACL) is viable; occupiers\u2019 liability remains untested but arguable.  \n\n**Areas for Judicial Clarification:**  \n- Classification of AR filters as \"goods\" under the ACL.  \n- Extending occupiers\u2019 liability to virtual spaces.  \n\nWould you like further elaboration on any specific issue?"

Key Convergences and Divergences**  \n\n**a) Areas of Alignment:**  \n- **Contract Law Principles:** Both jurisdictions uphold freedom of contract, enforceability of agreements, and remedies for breach.  \n- **Intellectual Property (IP) Protections:** Strong enforcement regimes for patents, trademarks, and copyrights, though Singapore follows a more codified approach.  \n- **Data Privacy:** Both have frameworks (PDPA in Singapore vs. sectoral laws in the US), but Singapore leans toward a unified regulatory model.  \n\n**b) Significant Differences in Legal Reasoning:**  \n- **Common Law vs. Statutory Interpretation:**  \n  - **Singapore:** Heavily codified (e.g., Contracts Act, Penal Code), with judicial deference to legislative intent.  \n  - **US:** Greater reliance on judicial precedent (e.g., *stare decisis*) and constitutional interpretation.  \n- **Regulatory Approach:**  \n  - **Singapore:** Proactive, government-led regulatory adjustments (e.g., fintech sandbox under MAS).  \n  - **US:** More litigation-driven, with agencies (SEC, FTC) reacting to market developments.  \n\n**c) Underlying Reasons for Differences:**  \n- **Legal Tradition:** Singapore\u2019s hybrid system (English common law + civil law influences) vs. US\u2019s federalist, precedent-heavy system.  \n- **Policy Priorities:** Singapore emphasizes stability and economic efficiency; the US balances federal vs. state powers and individual rights.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Practical Implications**  \n\n**a) Impact on Singapore Legal Practice:**  \n- **Drafting Contracts:** Must account for Singapore\u2019s stricter statutory defaults (e.g., implied terms under the Sale of Goods Act).  \n- **Dispute Resolution:** Singapore courts favor efficiency (e.g., summary judgment rules differ from US motion-to-dismiss standards).  \n\n**b) Cross-Jurisdictional Considerations:**  \n- **Enforcement of Judgments:** Singapore\u2019s reciprocal enforcement regime (under RECJA) differs from US state-by-state recognition rules.  \n- **Extraterritoriality:** US laws (e.g., FCPA, CFAA) may apply to Singapore entities with US ties, requiring dual compliance.  \n\n**c) Compliance Requirements:**  \n- **Corporate Governance:** SGX listing rules impose stricter independent director requirements than US exchanges.  \n- **Cybersecurity:** Singapore\u2019s Cybersecurity Act imposes proactive obligations, unlike the US\u2019s reactive breach notification laws.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **3. Risk Areas and Considerations**  \n\n**a) Potential Legal Challenges:**  \n- **Conflicts in Cross-Border Transactions:** Differing standards on indemnities, limitation of liability, and force majeure clauses.  \n- **Tech Regulation:** Singapore\u2019s prescriptive AI governance framework (e.g., IMDA\u2019s Model AI Governance Framework) contrasts with US self-regulation.  \n\n**b) Areas Needing Clarification:**  \n- **Digital Assets:** Singapore\u2019s Payment Services Act vs. US\u2019s SEC/CFTC jurisdictional overlap.  \n- **Labor Laws:** Singapore\u2019s Employment Act vs. US at-will employment doctrines.  \n\n**c) Regulatory Concerns:**  \n- **Anti-Money Laundering (AML):** Singapore\u2019s risk-based approach (MAS Notice 626) vs. US\u2019s Bank Secrecy Act strict liability risks.  \n- **Consumer Protection:** Singapore\u2019s CASE-led mediation vs. US class-action litigation culture.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **4. Implementation Recommendations**  \n\n**a) Actionable Steps:**  \n- **For Contracts:** Include Singapore-specific boilerplate clauses (e.g., governing law, arbitration under SIAC rules).  \n- **For Compliance:** Conduct dual-jurisdiction audits if operating in both markets (e.g., PDPA + CCPA alignment).  \n\n**b) Best Practices:**  \n- **Dispute Resolution:** Opt for Singapore arbitration (SIAC/ICC) to avoid US jury unpredictability.  \n- **Regulatory Engagement:** Proactively consult MAS/SGX for guidance on novel issues (e.g., crypto custody).  \n\n**c) Risk Mitigation Strategies:**  \n- **Training:** Educate teams on Singapore\u2019s strict liability regimes (e.g., CPF Act violations).  \n- **Insurance:** Secure D&O coverage for US exposure (e.g., securities litigation risks).  \n\n---  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nWhile Singapore and the US share common law roots, their legal frameworks diverge in regulatory philosophy and enforcement. Singapore practitioners should prioritize statutory compliance, leverage arbitration, and monitor MAS updates. For US-linked matters, proactive risk assessments are critical to navigate extraterritoriality and litigation exposure.  \n\n**Key Takeaway:** Adaptability and jurisdictional awareness are paramount\u2014Singapore\u2019s efficiency-driven system rewards proactive compliance, while the US demands litigation readiness.",
